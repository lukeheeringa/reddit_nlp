Coffee,Water not coming through the filter (delonghi dedica),"I recently bought a Delonghi Dedica.

It worked fine for a couple of weeks, and I always use the double container inside the puck.

However, since yesterday the coffee is not coming though. Is this a common issue with the filter or the container ?

Its not the puck as if I replace the double container with the single shot container is works fine.

Anyone has a similar issue with this ?

Coffee,There is a particular roasted property I can’t understand...,"I’m probably not nearly as hard core as many on this sub, so could really use your knowledge/help in figuring this out!!

Last year in NYC, my girlfriend (longtime coffee drinker/aficionado) and I would frequently go to a neighborhood Italian restaurant, where their coffee was unlike anything we’d ever had. It had this nutty roastedness/sweetness that was completely unique. The thing is, it was a pretty standard Lavazza. What’s more, it was highly inconsistent each time we went, until our regular server realized that it was only when the coffee was at the very bottom of the pot that it had this unique property (we would actually call in before coming, so important to us it became and so good was it!)

Anyway, we bought the same exact Lavazza for our home and nothing, no reproduction of that flavor. Other attempts to get that taste (Illy at Italian places, various espressos, general coffee drinking since, etc.) have yielded nothing. We got a Nespresso and while we’ve been enjoying it, absolutely no blend/variety has this.

So we chalked it up to a fluke, some quirk of chemistry that would be achieved again... who knows when?

But then this happened, and it blew our mind: on a short vacation we needed some quick, easy coffee and picked this up at a local grocery store:

https://www.target.com/p/starbucks-subtly-sweet-medium-roast-coffee-48-fl-oz/-/A-78295046

Mind you, neither of us like Starbucks all that much but again, it was a quick purchase and we figured it would be fine.

OH MY GOD. It was perfect, and it recreated the same experience as that Italian restaurant. *Something* about this particular product gives it that exact same roast flavor. We are enamored with it now. The thing is though, again, we don’t even like Starbucks traditionally and I can certainly attest that nothing we’ve ever drunk there even comes close to this.

So what do you all think? (Maybe even one of you would be willing to go try this (?)) We would love to determine what this property is so that we can obtain it more regularly, possibly even intensify it/find even better examples out there. It’s basically like we just discovered some spice and now want to know which cuisines use it in spades! :)

Thanks so much!!",1610569027

Coffee,"Share your ""perfect cup"" moment?","What's up reddit! I picked up brewing coffee about 7 months ago as a fun way to pass the time during lockdown. Sometimes you make a cup of coffee that is so perfect that you can't stop thinking about how good it is. What's that moment for you? I'll share mine!:

Over the months I've picked up a lot of new gear, beans, and skills that really helped me improve the quality of my brew. I'm a teacher, so at this point my bloodstream is probably 80% coffee. I actually got sick with COVID a few weeks ago and completely lost my sense of smell. It was absolutely miserable and coffee became completely flat and bitter. I couldn't get any complex notes of flavor, aroma, or anything. It was horrible. My sense of smell has gradually come back and I think I'm finally back this morning. I made my cup like I always do. #17 on my Barraza grinder, using my V60. I just bought myself a new kettle that allows me to get the perfect temperature on my water. I tried to be really deliberate with the pour and count out the time as well. When I finished brewing and took a sip, I was completely blown away by the flavor and aroma of the coffee I had just made. I always thought those tasting notes were a bit of bullshit, but this time  I really tasted the dark chocolate and cherry notes. It's something I've been thinking about since this morning. I don't know when I'll be able to create another cup that good, but I hope to try again later and see if I can come close.

Coffee,Some little bits of coffee advice that I haven't seen discussed much.,"Over time, I've picked up some little tidbits of knowledge through experimentation, and some of them don't seem to be discussed much. Here are a few little tips that some people light find useful.

* A lens blower is a fantastic tool for cleaning your grinder. It's the best way to clean out a grounds chute or burr chamber, but a toothbrush is still better for the burrs themselves.
* The first sip of a well-mixed espresso will have the worst taste but the best texture. This is due to crema. Crema tastes more bitter and less sweet than the rest of the espresso (crema-lovers need not reply), but it also has great texture (because foam), and if the strength of your espresso is homogenous because you stirred it, that will give the perception of more texture and more bitterness in the first sip of an espresso. For this reason, I would recommend skimming the crema off of your espressos when you are dialing in, when you typically only take one sip of an espresso.
* Never buy natural processed coffees from wet or cool regions (i.e. Guatemala, Sumatra). A lot of sun and heat is needed for a successful natural process (which is why it's relatively popular in parts of Africa), and naturals from cool or wet regions tend to stray on the side of barnyard as opposed to fruity and jammy. I can't fathom why roasters still sometimes sell naturals from cool/wet regions. I'm sure there are some good ones, but I haven't come across one yet. Locations of these wet/cool regions can be weird too, because while Guatemala is usually cool and wet, neighboring El Salvador is far hotter and drier on average, and produces some very good naturals.
* In filter coffee, I often find it easier to diagnose underextraction by looking for a lack of sweetness and texture than by looking for tons of sourness. I'll occasionally recalibrate my reference for underextraction by brewing a v60 with way too coarse of a grind size, and more often than not, the lack of sweetness and texture is more obvious than an increase of acidity. There is an increase in perceived acidity in underextracted coffee compared to well-extracted coffee, but it's not so obvious as to be the first thing I look for.

I hope at least a few people find this helpful, thanks for reading to the end, and have an excellent day.",1610560019

Coffee,Roast Level Perspective from 1975 Book,"I found an old book titled, ""[The Book of Coffee &amp; Tea](https://imgur.com/JPIbhU5)"" written in 1975. Within, the American preference for lighter-roasted coffees is described. I find it interesting to read the perspective of a time before Starbucks swept the nation, nearly 50 years ago. I thought you might as well. Specifically, this line makes me grin:

""A thick syrupy decoction of dark-roasted beans is the choice, nay, the passion of coffee lovers throughout Europe and Latin America. We Americans should treat ourselves more often to the pleasures offered by this vigorous brew.""

Here are links to photos of the pages, and the transcribed text:

[The Variety of Roasts](https://imgur.com/hsEfhPB)

The roasting of coffee turns the beans brown; the longer they're roasted, the darker they get. Coffee roasted too light won't have much of a coffee taste at all. Coffee can also be roasted so dark that it tastes burnt. Between these two extremes are a variety of roasts all tasting like coffee, each appealing to particular tastes.

Simply put, the darker coffee is roasted, the darker it tastes. Is any one roast the optimum? No, just as it would be silly to say that steak should only be broiled ""medium."" Is dark-roasted coffee stronger? No. It is common to credit dark-roasted coffee with producing a very, very strong beverage, but this is not accurate. It would be best to say that dark-roasted coffee has a characteristic ""dark-roasted"" taste, even if that may seem to be begging the question. The strength of coffee is directly dependent on the amount of soluble solids in the brew, that is, the solution of coffee in water. If coffee is ""strong"" it should be because more coffee is used, resulting in a stronger solution, not because of the roast itself. Espresso is in fact usually brewed with twice the amount of coffee normally recommended.

Not only does coffee get darker in color the longer it is roasted, but it also loses more weight and swells more in size. Oils held within the beans of a lighter roast are driven to the surface in a dark roast. Dark-roasted beans appear shiny. They have very slightly less caffeine and are somewhat less acidic than light-roasted beans. They are slightly more susceptible to becoming stale because surface waxes that remain intact on light-roasted beans are destroyed by more prolonged heating. The characteristic dark roasted flavor tends to overshadow the more subtle flavors produced by lighter roasting. Some of the more delicate flavor oils and aromatics are in fact destroyed by dark roasting. What dark-roasted coffee may lack in subtlety, it more than makes up for in force. A thick syrupy decoction of dark-roasted beans is the choice, nay, the passion of coffee lovers throughout Europe and Latin America. We Americans should treat ourselves more often to the pleasures offered by this vigorous brew.

[Detailed Roast Levels](https://imgur.com/CMFrZsX)

Light city roast: In sections of the West, this is the standard. The bean is not fully developed, the color more cinnamon-like than brown, the flavor thin.

City roast: The most widely used style in this country. Also called brown roast or American roast, it is the preference of most consumers here. This roast yields a beverage that may lack brilliance and come up on the flat side.

Full city roast: Favored by some regional roasters in cosmopolitan centers, particularly New York City. Slightly longer roasted, the bean is dark brown, shows no oil on the surface, and gives a deeper heartier cup. The American roasts of specialty shops are likely to be full city rather than city.

Brazilian: Don't confuse this with the name given to coffee grown in Brazil. Just darker than full city, this roast has the faintest hint of dark roast flavor. A trace of oil shows on the bean.

Viennese roast: There seems to be the least consensus on what this roast is, probably because there are many variations, even in Vienna. It falls midway between full city and French roasts. Mix half and half of these two roasts.

French roast (New Orleans roast): With this roast oiliness is quite apparent on the bean's surface and the color is burnt umber, the color of semi sweet chocolate. The flavor is remarkably different from any of the lighter roasts. It approaches Espresso flavor but remains smooth. It is French roasted coffee to which chicory is added for Louisiana style coffee. Two commercially prepared examples of this coffee/chicory mixture are Luzianne and French Market.

Spanish/Cuban/French-Italian roast: Darker than French but not quite Italian, this coffee is great for those who want Espresso without the bite. Mix French and Italian roasts, if this happy medium is not available, and you'll get very close to the flavor. Commercially prepared versions of this roast are Bustelo and El Pico. Some A&amp;P stores have coffee in this roast in the bean.

Italian/ Espresso roast: This roast is the highest, heaviest, darkest. Almost to carbonization. The bean surface is shiny and oily, the color black, the flavor Italian. Medaglia D'Oro is a commercially prepared example of this roast.

Coffee,"Been manual brewing since last October, some tips","It took me a while to dial in my tastes (I brew exclusively with V60 and Aeropress, 1-2 cups) and there are a few things which really helped me along the way. At first, the coffee was just not coming out very good at all (bitter, intense, severe) and it took me a lot of trial and error to get to a consistent point.

\- Invest in a temperature controlled kettle. This helps you keep another variable constant as you dial in your taste. Obviously you should already have a nice burr grinder which is the first biggest investment. I pretty much stick with 96C for all my light roasts.

\- Google image search coffee grind size. This one had the largest impact on taste for me. I thought I was grinding medium-fine but it was closer to fine, and in the end I actually moved to more of a medium grind for both my V60 and Aeropress. It also depends on the coffee bean, strangely enough. For one light roast I was sitting at 22 on the Baratza Encore, but for a different light roast that was coming out harsh and i moved towards 24 (this confused me because I saw a lot of other people using around 15-16 grind setting, but when i compared my grind size to images online i found it was much too fine on my machine. So not all sizes are universal, i guess. It took me a LONG time to figure this out, because going from 15-16 to 18 wasn't giving me much of a difference). 

\- If you are buying your beans at a local coffee shop, ask them to do a pour over for you of the coffee you are buying. This helped me a lot because i was able to compare and constrast with how i was brewing. I actually prefer my brew method now compared to how they brewed because i like to brew a smoother cup, but i have a jumping off point for how it should taste.

\- Stick to the same recipe so you again are keeping variables as constant as possible, and just messing with one at a time.

\- Brew small batches (15g, etc) and more times in a day so you can play around with the recipe, and then move towards a larger brew once you dial it in. Some days i would do 3-4 brews lol, its fun!

&amp;#x200B;

Now i get the subtle hints in the taste once i dialed it in, for example i am doing this El Salvador brew right now which has hints of honey in it, very nice! I shared some of my coffee with neighbor and family and they said i ruined their coffee for them, they tasted no bitterness, said it was the smoothest cup they have had and now having trouble going back to their bitter coffee!

I started by watching some YouTube videos primarily this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0g8umpINGQ&amp;feature=youtu.be

So here how I understand it is 18g dose, 2:1 extraction with a final espresso yield of 36g over 25-30secs. 

First problem: I started on a grind setting of 6 following exactly what the video does it. What I've realized is especially with the Sagada Dark roast 18g does not even some close to fitting in the portafilter, the Columbian it's way below. How worried should I be about dose vs the spacing? I'm using the standard tamper which I know isn't consistent but it just doesn't seem right. 


The biggest problem: I set it to program and time out how long it takes to get to 36g. On a grind setting of 6 no matter what it always seems to be around 8-12secs. Even on the finest of settings no matter the coffee, no matter how much I tamper it, no matter how much I change I am NO WHERE clue to 25-30secs.

Coffee,Brewing a single cup in a V60 02,"I am new to this coffee game and I'm experimenting with the Hario V60 (I have the 02 version).  I've made some great brews using Hoffman's V60 technique and 30:500 ratio of coffee to water.  I'm wanting to perform more precise experiments without blowing through beans too quickly.  I tried brewing a single cup (10g coffee to 167g water) and it came out under extracted and bitter.  It was the same grind size and timing I had used for my good pot that was 30:500.  Any ideas where I might have gone wrong?  I fear the 02 version may not be well suited for brewing a single cup, as I did not have a flat bed of grounds at the end, despite my efforts.  However, I am new at this, so it may also be something I haven't thought of yet.

The only difference I can think of besides the amount of coffee brewed is the water.  Last time, I used regular tap, but this time I used distilled water with Epsom salt and Baking soda added according to Barista Hustle's recipe.  Will that change extraction?

Coffee,Help with slow V60 brew time (&gt;5:00 for 250ml),"I've been using [James Hoffmann's Ultimate V60 Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo&amp;ab_channel=JamesHoffmann) to brew coffee. I've been practicing a few times a day for a couple of months now so I'm confident that I'm following the steps properly. The comments in the video suggest that the 500ml of water he uses should result in around a 3:30 total brew time. Then at lower volumes the time should redcue, e.g. 2:30 for 250ml.

Here is all of the information related to my brew:

V60: Plastic Hario V60 02

Filter: Bleached Hario V60 02 (made in Austria)

Coffee: 15g

Water: 250ml

I'm consistently seeing brew times over 5:00 when I feel like I should be aiming for something between 2:30 and 3:00.

I get a bag of freshly roasted coffee delivered to me each week which is pre-ground for filter. This is far from ideal but my current living situation doesn't allow for an electric grinder. I have a [Hario Skerton hand grinder](https://www.hario.co.uk/products/skerton-hand-coffee-grinder) that I could use for some tests at the weekend if people could reccommend the number of notches to set it to for V60. Maybe the grind I'm being sent is too fine? I just don't have time to hand-grind beans every morning before work.

I'm also aware that the filter papers made outside of Japan are slower so I could try and get my hands on a faster paper next time I run out.

Would I get better results with the 01 size V60 when I am just brewing 250ml for myself or should this not really make a difference?",1610552505

Coffee,Mocccamaster and Breville Smart Grinder Pro - Looking for pointers,"Hello! I've spent some time on this sub trying to improve my at home brewing over the past year. One of the best changes I made thanks to reading was using proper mineralized water over our very heavy tap water (San Diego). 

Our morning pots have improved a lot since then. Also moved to better local beans (Dark Horse Coffee). We like medium to light roasts, we drink it black and enjoy finding the notes of the beans. 

Equipment:

* Moccamaster with Manual Basket
* Breville Smart Grinder Pro. Usually use the lowest end of the Drip setting, but lately have been trying going coarser
* Third Water water
* 0.01 gram precision scale
* Melitta #4 white filters
* Ratio is 1000 ml water (not usually weighed though, using brewer tank markings) and 62g coffee

Lately I've been feeling like our coffee hasn't been the best it can be. I've played around with grind sizes and Moccamaster techniques, and I feel like lately nothing I do seems to get me to the sweet spot. Especially when comparing my version of the brew to a drip coffee of the same beans from the local shop.

The Moccamaster technique I use is rinsing the paper filter with 200 ml water, adding grounds and locking basket, stirring grounds and opening basket full way. Stirring halfway through (at about 500 ml), then tapping basket once water tank is empty. I've tried letting the grounds bloom by turning off the coffee maker, but I haven't been very consistent with this.

I've been using a spreadsheet to track grind size setting, water and coffee amount, and notes about the brewing technique as well as rating each brew. 

So, I think at this point my issue is the Breville grinder. When I first got it, I read a lot of people saying it wasn't the best for drip, as it was better suited for espresso. Back then I liked the idea of having a hopper to hold the beans and a programmable timer to determine how much coffee to use. I no longer use either of those features so it has become a decoration that is used in a very manual way.

I've tried using the Coffee Compass to dial in the brews, but I must admit I am not very good at determining exactly where I am, if it's under or over extracted. I just know it's not as good. Sometimes it's too bitter, sometimes it's a bit ""vegetal"" (I think).

One thing I've noticed with the beans I get, is that there are a lot of lighter colored grinds, that look like shavings, at the top of the ground beans. Are these the fines that I read about? Are these bad/unwanted and an indicator of an issue with the grinder or its configuration? Will these produce unwanted flavor profiles?

One metric I am not very clear on is, how much time should 1000 ml of water take to brew on the Moccamaster. I see between 4 to 6 minutes. I start counting as soon as the water hits the grounds, but do I turn off the basket when the flow becomes a drip? How long do I wait before shutting off the basket and stopping the counter.

This morning I went coarser than usual, and counted about 5 minutes from water hitting the grounds to all the water in the basket being below the grounds and the flow becoming a drip. Used La Colombe Mexico Sierra Sur (sometimes we buy these if we're in UTC) and even though I got one of the notes when smelling it (rose), the coffee tastes a bit salty/sour/vegetal (I think). So that would tell me I went too coarse on the grounds. Yesterday, with a finer grind than today, it was a bit bitter

Anyway, any tips would be highly appreciated as I must be missing something.",1610552110
Coffee,Grind time too long - espresso with an Encore,"I have a new Breville Bambino and I'm using my Encore grinder set at 10-12. And I'm okay with the results. I know both machines are entry-ish, but they're suiting me just fine for now. My only complaint is the amount of time it takes to grind 18g of beans in the Encore. Sometimes 2 minutes - or longer. There is always a lot of popcorning of beans at the end. Is this a normal time? When I'm grinding for a pour over, at around 18, it takes a much shorter amount of time. And I understand that's due to grind size. But... 2 minutes seems extreme. Or is it? 

I assume higher-end grinders will do this job faster. But what's a step up from here - one for both pour overs and espresso grinds, that will accomplish its tasks more quickly?",1610551563

I am currently in a situation where I am looking to upgrade my coffee grinder for drip coffee only. My initial plan was to get a Wilfa Uniform, as it is right in my budget. But, it turns out getting one to the US is currently a but more difficult and expensive than I thought it would be.

I know that the Fellow Ode is right in the same price range, but I have heard very mixed reviews that make me think that it may not be worth the money. I also check r/coffeeswap pretty consistently, but haven't seen any electric brew grinders posted recently.

I currently have a Kinu Simplicity with the espresso burrs, and an Encore with the upgraded M2 Burrs. Do you think that I should just keep what I have and wait until I have a bit larger of a budget to really upgrade?

Coffee,V60 problems adjusting for the perfect cup,"So, I’ve had my V60 for around two weeks now. I’ve been using it pretty much daily following James Hoffmann’s v60 technique. 

The first week or so I managed to brew wonderful coffee. The coffee bed was flat after each brew and the coffee tasted evenly extracted, clear and sweet. Then I wanted to experiment a bit and started messing with water temperatures and grind sizes. The coffee got gradually worse and I struggled to get a flat grounds bed even when I tried. I always ended up with a dome in the middle of the grounds. Yesterday I hit the rock bottom and brewed so over-extracted and astrigent coffee that I couldn’t drink it. Today I tried to go back to the same water temperature and grind setting I had last time I brewed a great cup - to no avail. The coffee was better than yesterday, yet still bitter or sour.

What troubles me the most, is that I really don’t know what I’m doing wrong or differently from what I did at the beginning, when the coffee was still good. I’m using Wilfa Uniform grinder and the last great cup of coffee was with grind setting 24. Water temperatures I’ve used have all been within 94-97 celsius range for medium roasted coffee. The drawdowns have been 2:50-3:30 minutes. I’m using 30g of coffee to 500g of water. The coffee itself is good and of great quality.

Coffee,[Gear] Grinder recommendations - for multiple grind settings,"Hi everyone.

I am a fan of using lots of different ways of making coffee. Some days cafetiere, some days espresso, some days mokka, pour over... 

Right now I have a hand grinder for espresso &amp; pour over and then just get the place I get my coffee from to grind it for me in a reasonable ""general purpose"" setting for the other methods.

**Does anyone know of a product on the market (new or used) that sort of lets me change the grind setting and quantity on the fly?**

I am not too fussed about whether it has a large hopper or if you have the weight the beans and fill it up for each grind. I am also kind of willing to sacrifice a bit of grind quality for the functionality (after all its just has to be better than using pre-ground). 

I am fairly flexible on budget. But ideally less than £200 (~270usd, ~230eur)... but I am interested to hear whats on the market at a higher price point if its gong to be worth it; if it can be had for even cheaper then I am all ears.

I bought a Salter EK3131 a few months ago to replace my AeroPress as I wanted something that automated the process a little more. I wasn't expecting anything amazing for the price and expected that I would need to tweak to taste. However, I just can't quite seem to figure out where i'm going wrong.

I'm using the same beans Lavazza Espresso Italiano Coffee Beans and the same amount of beans ( the recommend amount for an Aeropress).  


With the Aeropress, the coffee was darker in colour and richer in flavour. The smell is usually rich and lovely like a coffee shop.  
With the Salter, the coffee is lighter in colour and taste more burny/bitter. The smell is also more bitter/burnt.   


I initially thought it was the grind, so I made it finer first, which seemed to increase the burn and started making it more course. It's still more fine than the Aeropress, and the taste has improved, but it still lacks flavour, lighter in colour and has a slight taste of bitter and water.

Coffee,Is the Niche Zero worth $250 more vs the Eureka Mignon Specialita for my case?,"Hello, I've been doing some research on these machines. The Niche would be \~$750 and the Specialita would be \~$500. From what I've read, the main differences seem to be flat vs conical burrs, slightly lower retention and easier grind adjustments on the niche. So in terms of quality, it seems like the Specialita may be slightly better due to flat burrs(?), however, I'm still a novice so I'm sure I won't be able to tell the difference for now. And the convenience and ease-of-use goes to the Niche. However, I want to confirm if this is truly the case for individuals that may have done research or have owned both machines. If so, is the Niche Zero worth $250 more?

**Things to consider**

* Will be used strictly for espresso.
* I usually stick with the same beans until I finish my current bag, then switch to a different one (\~2 weeks).
* I usually make 1-2 drinks a day.
* I don't mind dosing out the coffee very time.",1610478967
Coffee,My new 1Zpresso JX makes an awful sound when removing/attaching the bottom chamber,"Just received my 1Zpresso JX - my first coffee grinder. When I screw off the bottom chamber, it makes a very harsh screeching noise from the two metal parts rubbing together. I’ve watched a few videos of the grinder being used and it doesn’t make the same noise 

I’ve not actually used the grinder yet but would assume it still works as expected. I’ve emailed 1Zpresso who have advised that it’s not a common issue and it could be worth using a small amount of cooking oil on both parts - I’m slightly reluctant to do this because I think I’d have to do it fairly frequently, and I wouldn’t want it to impact the bean flavours.

Coffee,Better grind consistency on cheap hand grinders,"Just a quick tip I figured out last week that rapidly improved my cups. I own a Hario Skerton Plus and while it has a stabilizing plate built-in, I still find it yields pretty inconsistent results for coarser settings. 

Before, I always lifted it up and just turned the handle until it's finished. What I didn't know was how much the position in which you hold the handle affects the result. Holding it more upwards or downwards tilts the burr and makes some beans far too coarse while others end up far too fine. 

Now, I try to hold the handle as much in place as possible by dragging it outside, orthogonal to the grinder. I also find that turning it too slow or too fast makes it hard to keep the angle so there is a sweet spot that is probably different for everyone.

This technique particularly resulted in less filter clogging, presumably because there are less fine grounds, and has made my coffee routine much more enjoyable.

My question for you, are there similar tweaks that I might not be aware of to get the most out of cheaper hand grinders?",1610475943
Coffee,Budget (~£100/$136/€110) grinder suggestions,"Over the last year, I’ve been making a lot more coffee due to working from home. This led me to graduating from Nespresso to an Aeropress, which I’m absolutely loving.  
I’ve been buying pre-ground coffee from as many different roasters as I can, but I’m worried that the grind isn’t a variable I can control as much in this scenario, so I’d like to give this a go myself. 

So with that in mind, I’m looking for a grinder, either hand or electric, whichever I can get the best bang for my buck. My budget is around £100, but don’t mind stretching that a little bit, if it means I’m getting a far better product. 

I’m the only one in the house who drinks coffee, so I don’t need to grind huge amounts at once.  
I’ll only be brewing using the Aeropress, although I am considering trying v60 at some point, so as long as the grinder can handle both of those, that’ll be fine.",1610475579

Coffee,How often do you fail to entirely saturate the bloom by swirling (V60)?,"This is mostly a question about the mechanics of the swirl and what can affect it. 

I've noticed when I used the Hoffmann V60 method that it could be somewhat inconsistent. One of the reasons for that inconsistency was that sometimes the coffee bed failed to be entirely saturated during the bloom phase. Even after five to ten vigorous swirls, I could be left with coffee clinging to the filter, refusing to mix in an homogeneous slurry and some water sitting on top.

Here are some of the factors that impact this uneven saturation:

- Coffees that produce a lot of fines are more difficult to mix

- Coffee that is ground finer can be harder to saturate. These days I grind quite fine, so that's an issue for me. 

- Not swirling vigorously enough.

- Not pouring vigorously enough.

- The divot at the centre is not deep enough (grounds at the bottom don't get mixed in the slurry), the divot at the centre is too deep (water flows through too quickly)

- Excessively compacting some grinds while I'm making a divot. 

Once I have gotten to know how a specific bean behaves, it can be quite consistent, but I usually only stay with a bag a short while. So, because of that initial variability, I have switched to stirring like a mad lad with a teaspoon, that works well for me, takes care of my previous reproducibility issues and gives me delicious coffees.

Still, many people seem to prefer the swirl method taste wise. Have any of you dealt with unevenly saturated grounds during the bloom phase? How common or uncommon an issue is this for you? What factors have you found impact even saturation? How do you deal with it?",1610471985

Recently tried Directors Blend from Coffee Direct, definitely a profound feeling a anxiety for a few hours after a couple of strong cups, had the same with their Turbo beans too, maybe very high caffeine in that one.

Coffee,Reddit Coffee Recommendation Burnout,"Let me start off by saying that I love this sub. I've learnt so much and gotten way more into the entire coffee process as a result. 

That being said....

The advice you get on this sub for some questions can be infuriating. Recently I've been trying to make my V60 cups brighter, so I searched posts with people asking the same question. The comments people give are completely contradictory. Some say finer grind, some coarser, water right off the boil, water slightly cooled down, swirl, don't swirl. Some people say the grinder has the biggest affect, others say water. Hell, even the 2 biggest names in the game, Hoffman and Rao, might not exactly contradict each other, but still have differing advice. Just the term ""Bright"" itself I've seen defined here as sweet, sour or acidic. Maybe that's the problem.

All the opposing views are sort of turning me off instead of making me want to try every single method. It makes me actually think that the beans themselves are 99% responsible for the taste and whatever method people use when using great beans,they think that's the best way when in fact swirling counter clockwise vs clockwise has no affect at all.",1610465959

Coffee,The noob chronicles: aeropress and timemore c2,"After harsh resistance to boomers and they're new fangled technologies, I finally decided to check out the aeropress. And overall I am quite pleased.

The aeropress is really simple to use. I decided to set some standards in tuning in my process.

Ratio I use is 16g coffee to 150g water.

 First standard was temperature, I would pour from my kettle as soon as I heard the first whistle. This is by no means a scientific measurement, but is close enough for my uses. 

Second is ""steep and stir time. I keep it short, main goal is to feel around the plunger for coffee sticking and make sure no visible clumps are floating. Then I immediately flip and press.

With these 2 ""controls"" I adjust the grind to taste: finer if sour, coarser if bitter. By the third brew, I found 8 clicks out on my timemore c2 to be the sweet spot for my setup.

A few notes I have learned.

For me, (rinsed) paper filter is better than metal filter. Was not happy with the results from the 3 metal filters I have tried. Luckily my aeropress came with about 700 paper filters.

when using the inverted method, HOLD THE BODY AND PLUNGER! Should be common sense, but common sense is something I lack before coffee. Plunger will fall off. Never lost much liquid when I had it fall off, but it does flick some grounds onto the countertop.

The c2 on 8 clicks takes forever. Seriously, I have found myself not having a second cup only because I don't want to swing my arms around for another couple minutes(it feels like a couple minutes, I haven't timed it). I'm a...stronger than average guy, and I really wish there was more resistance, or feel that I'm doing work when grinding this fine. I've explored using power tools to grind, however in timemores infinite wisdom, they have made the hex shaft on the c2 an awkward size. 5mm socket doesn't fit, 6mm too large, 3/16 too small, 7/32 barely grabs but not enough to have confidence that I won't strip the shaft. I don't own a 5.5mm socket(in about 20 years of spinning ratchets, I cannot recall a single situation where I've needed one either), but there's no guarantee that will fit either.

Due to this...annoyance, I'm left with 2 options: replace the grinder, or upgrade the burrs to the new e&amp;b burr set. I'm leaning towards upgrading the burrs. Its about $45 for the burr set and if I'm still not satisfied I know people who will be, and I would happily gift them the grinder.

I’m just wondering if it’s normal for there to be slight slippage over time - I grind 30g of coffee a day and I’ve been doing so since October so the grinder is definitely seasoned. Cause for concern or am I overthinking this?

Coffee,Cuisinart Coffee Center (SS-15P1) Single Serve Help!,"I purchased the Cuisinart Coffee Center for my new apartment (my first apartment!) and was thrilled at the idea to have a pot for coffee when I'm home all morning, and the single-serve for K-cups when I have to run out quickly for class. But I can't seem to get the single-serve to work, and the directions aren't clear (enough for me). 

At first, I put my k-cup in the little gray holder, and it exploded once I hit brew. Also saw that the top was punctured by the holder, but there was no puncture in the bottom. Then I put the k-cup in without the gray holder, and went to brew, and saw that the bottom nor the top of the k-cup was ever punctured. 

What am I missing? Do I need to do something to activate the needle? Do I use the grey pod to put the k-cup into? Why isn't it puncturing? I totally feel that this operator error vs machine error, but the instructions aren't helping!",1610427188

Coffee,Breville barista express 870 - cleaned burrs,"Hi all

First time poster. Couldn't  find a post on this issue so wondering if it's  an easy fix. I recently got a barista  express 870 in december. After playing around abit after struggling  on getting timing right ive finally landed on a grind of around 2-3 that worked consistently with our coffee beans: using a single wall double filter i got about 8 secs preinfusions and a total of usually 28-33sec shots  (including pre infusion) which i presume is ""ok""? It was good enough for the mrs anyhow.  Come sunday i did my first clean of the burrs. Removed the top burr with the metal bar (gosh its hard to turn. Thought id snap the metal handle lifter) and used the brush to brush the inside and top burr of the coffee dust.   

Come today ive used it for the first time. Same beans. Never moved the grind dial. Got 6 secs pre infusion and an under extraxted pressure. Whole thing flushed  out in 18 secs or less. Thought id gotten too soft with the tamp but after doing 2 more attempts ive gotten similar results . Even under  tamping in the past ive not had this short of a time. I did feel the grind is suddenly more coarse and sand like.

Is it common to remove the burrs  and have the coarseness suddenly increase? Do i need to lock it into place  even  tighter (top burr - it's  in lock position but i found it quite hard to clockwise turn into this position) to revert it back to how it was grinding pre clean? Or is there some other setting when brush cleaning  i could have physically inadvertently  changed?

On another note  presuming i can get the grinding/ extraction back  to pre clean levels...any advice out of the 3 variables  to adjust: coffee grind, coffee quantity and tamping pressure - what do i change to lower pre infusion  time yet keep extraction post infusion   time the same? Ive found the only way pre infusion drops to 6s which is where some recommend (from my 8-9 secs) is when tamping lighter or less coffee but both result in a shorter extraction time. Tamping harder lengthens the extraction time naturally but bumps up the pre infusion time? Im struggling on how to get the 6 sec magical pre infusion window yet  still hit that 20-28 sec extraction  time people recommend? I just use the double espresso auto button (so no manual espresso).

Also my barista said to use a double walled filter  always but the manual  recommenda single wall as double wall is for pre ground etc? Curious  if barista or manual is right?

Thanks for any advice",1610416790

Coffee,Eureka Mignon Filtro upgrade,"So let me preface all of this by saying I'm coming from using a Bodum Bistro for about 8 years (falling apart the last 2) so anything short of a blade grinder is probably going to feel amazing.

Short long term review of the Bodum. When I purchased mine it was during a brand fallout of sorts at JCPenny and they had all Bodum products down like 70% or 80% off. At the $30-$40 I paid for it, I couldn't be happier. It served me well over those years helping me hone in on my technique and it wasn't until around the 5-6 year mark that I started to notice problems. It no longer would grind down into the finer setting and slowly over time it would get slower and coarser. Eventually getting me frustrated enough to want an upgrade. RIP

I had always fawned over the idea of uprading to the Baratza Encore but being a broke parent in their 20's, that's not the easiest thing always. The Encore to me always was the gold standard entry filter grinder. So that was my initial thought when a second round of stimulus was up and I had been doing alright through this whole pandemic. But after going to the website and adding it to my cart something just felt wrong. After being a huge coffee geek for close to a decade (I got an aeropress in 2013) I just felt worthy of something more than just the ""entry level"".

This is where my research for a different option soon began. My first thought was get the Encore and get the upraged Virtuoso burrs but I didn't really want to have to fuss with swapping out parts on a new machine. I recently had been seeing the Fellow Ode pop up on every youtubers channel and it seemed like good competition. But James Hoffman had explained it as just not being able to go quite fine enough. He did mention they would soon release a new burr set that would fix that, but then I'm right back into having to upgrade a new machine, not to mention the &gt;$300 pricetag at that point.

Then I found the not as much talked about Eureka Mignon line of grinders. I looked around and noticed the Filtro and Chrono were almost exact from my view and the Filtro was at an astonishing $209 on Seattle Coffee Gear with many similar features to the higher end grinders (flat burrs). I tried looking around to see if many others recommend it and wanted more info and kept coming up short on finding reviews about them. I figured for what Eureka is known for in their other grinders and the specs they provide I would be somewhat of a test dummy and pull the trigger.

I kept looking around online for reviews while I waited for it to arrive anxiously, trying to find validation that my purchase was worth it. I found others were in a similar position with not much out there in terms of reviews or info on the grinder.

SO, now here I am, with a massive caffeine buzz after the many cups of coffee from dialing the Filtro in (and the novel above) I have to say, it is an amazing grinder!

Initial reaction was just WOW from the beautiful all black exterior and finish to the speed and evenness of the grind. ALL coffee I was brewing before was missing this clarity and that special something I had always experienced at my favorite local cafe, and instantly on the first grind I could tell this thing was something different than the Bistro I loved to hate. I don't really review stuff generally so I don't know what people want to know. But I just wanted to open a forum for people to ask questions and discuss if they wanted some more info on the Eureka Mignon Filtro!

tldr: I love my new Filtro and think it is a worthy upgrade or even a great entry into burr grinders for use at home.",1610415807

Coffee,Sort of a silly question but how should I adjust my French press recipe if I’m upgrading mug size from 14-20 Oz?,"I make a single cup of French press coffee daily on weekdays and 2 times a day on weekends.

However I just started online school today and decided to to buy a 20 OZ mug instead since the 14OZ is finish within the first hour of my 3 hour class. 

Anyways my question is how should I adjust my recipe for a 20 Oz mug and keep the taste about the same?

As a coffee novice, I enjoy a cup of French press coffee, mostly following the guidelines laid out in the James Hoffman video.

James suggests going for quite a while longer; I do 5 + 5 minutes, but the coffee doesn't taste too bitter due to over-extraction. Maybe I rather like the bolder flavors? What's the story here?

Coffee,"Popular V60 filters relative to each other? Cafec, Kono, Origami","Seems the Hario untabbed filters (40 ct) were popular, but have been seeing recommendations of Cafec filters performing even better (less clogging, reasonably faster drawdown time). That along with the fact that it is cheaper makes it seem like it's an obvious replacement for your go-to filters.

But Cafec has the traditional filters (which I assume most people are basing their comparisons with Hario on), Abaca version (which also seems as popular), and roast-specific (light, medium, and dark) filters. How do the Cafec offerings compare and in particular traditional vs. Abaca (which I assume are more for general-purpose before experimenting with their roast-specfic versions)?

And finally, there's Kono and Origami filters. I believe Origami might be the fastest of all the filters mentioned and Kono probably more similar to Cafec traditional and/or Abaca version.

Faster filters seem to be preferred in general because it lets you grind finer (for better extraction?), but I'm curious if there's a point where needing to grind too fine because the filter has too short of a drawdown is a detriment. I'm also interested to see if people who have tried the Cafec roast-specific versions actually found them to be worthwhile. I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIKSvEtBfyw) where the guy has tried the filters have preferred them over the traditional Cafec filters, but I feel his testing is flawed because he uses the same grind settings to compare between the traditional and roast-specific versions. That might be how Cafec intended or designed their filters around to using the same grind setting, but it would have been more interesting to give the traditional filter a better chance by dialing in a different grind setting.",1610406665

Coffee,Looking for a new / second brewing method next to my espresso machine!,"I'm looking to step away from espresso for a while, and I'm looking for a new method. I'm interested in a drip coffee of some kind. If anyone is willing to help me; here is my wall of text! :) (thanks in advance for the advices!)

Current setup:
- Compak K6 grinder
- Rancillio Sylvia w/ MeCoffee PID

Why:
I've been using this combination for a few years now, and I'm kind of growing tired of it. While I'm quite consistently pulling great shots that I reallly enjoy, the error marigin is really small. Half a gram too much, the machine clogs. Beans are a week older now, your shot will be 100ml and sour. My grinder is also stepped, and the difference between the 2 steps that I'm in means that if I'm out of luck; the ideal setting is not available; and I get either too strong or too weak shots. Anyways; this sounds like complaining, but I've been very satisfied until now and it has been a fun journey. However, in stead of upgrading my equipment; I think it is best for me find an alternative brewing method. While I enjoy espressos; it is quite intensive to ONLY have espressos. I don't really need to improve my setup; I want something different. 

What am I looking for:
I'm looking for something like a chemex, V60, kalita, etc. I enjoy the chocolatey and hazelnutty aroma's the most. I don't really enjoy the fruity and exotic beans. I'm looking to brew a very full bodied ('fat' if you will) coffee. More balanced than complex; I think. Which method fits best for this kind of coffee? 

Another small note is that I'd love to easily make different volumes of coffee, without too much hassle. Sometimes I have guests, I'd like to be able to brew 500ml. When I'm alone, 150ml would be enough. (this was annoying with my espresso setup. 4 guests arriving; I'll be back in 15 minutes)

Then a final question:
How do I find the right grind size? My grinder is relatively obscure and I can't find any references. It took quite some trial and error to find the right grind size; but I have no idea how far I have to dial it back at all. I know how to finetune, but the first big switch? 3 clicks? 20 clicks? more?",1610388563

Coffee,Absolute beginner; cheap or premium grinder?,"Hi everyone,

After spending most of my life wanting nothing to do with coffee (probably due to having bad experiences with probably bad coffee when I was younger), I finally decided that maybe I should give this thing a go afterall. I have done a bit of research and settled on getting an Aeropress for my first brewer, but I'm stuck on the grinder part...
  
I initially had my eyes set on a cheaper Hario, either the smaller one or the Skerton Pro, both often mentioned on the internet. Then a couple of days later I found out that one can and should spend much more on a grinder, so down the rabbit hole I went. In the end, I decided on an 1zpresso JX as it seemed to be a great grinder at a (barely) acceptable price range. Now then...
  
Given that I am pretty much all new to coffee, and with it the chance that I just don't like coffee regardless of how good or bad it is, should I try it out with a cheaper grinder first or bite the bullet and start the better one? Would the Hario be a hindrance to me getting into coffee? Though I have seen many here proclaim a substantial improvement in their drinks after upgrading their grinders, I am not sure that I have the palates necessary to detect the difference. Which one should I get? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1610382265

Coffee,Talk me into or out of a purchase (drip machine)...,"I have an Baratza Encore grinder.. I spent more than I had in the past and got a good burr grinder. I love fresh ground coffee, and was making fantastic cold brew.

Fast forward a bit, and I'm exploring the idea of a drip machine. I want some simplicity and a bit of automation in the morning rather than manual pour over. Right now the only machine in my apartment is my roommates OG Keurig that I use a mesh filter for. And I hate it.

I have 2 roommates who would probably benefit from this, and have a healthy coffee habit.

I discovered SCA and also understand that sometimes the certification can be expensive, and likely drives an additional premium price tag. I've been hearing a lot about the Moccamasters.

I appreciate quality and value it highly. I think I'm resistant less so because of the machine or price, but more so that I'm yet again going with the popular choice on reddit - which kinda makes me feel like a (insert self deprecating insult here).

For the coffee lovers out there, if I'm looking for an alternative to the manual pour over or french press, what else could you recommend outside of the Moccamaster that has good value and quality? Particularly at best buy because I have gift cards 🙂.

For the Moccamasters out there, any recommendations or things to consider while choosing one or getting started? Do I need to manually attend to the brew while it's going to stir grounds or to time the bloom?  Does it overflow a lot? How is maintenance?",1610379383

I'm looking to get myself a new grinder. I've been using a Hario slim mill for several years up until the burrs started decomposing (yes, I know Hario grinders are far from ideal but it got the job done more or less)
The thing is, I don't brew espresso at home and I don't plan to very soon, I'm into pour over (for which I prefer a medium coarse for Kasuya's 4:6), aeropress and french press. I've been looking into buying a comandante, but that's just too expensive for me.

Coffee,Help! Trying everything to get a better cup and im stumped.,"I am perpetually stuck in coffee mediocrity limbo and im not sure where else to go at this point so if you could help that would be greatly appreciated.

First of all: I always use a 1:16 ratio for my V60, and im making enough coffee to serve two people. 35 g of ground coffee, yielding 544g. 
Ive played a lot with grind and generally find that the best i can do is at around the 14-16 setting on Encore, medium fine with a 4-4:30 draw down, following the Rao method. Sometimes ive tried much coarser and went for a 3:30 draw down only to find the coffee too weak and sour.

My setup uses the Plastic V60 (Size 02), i use the appropriate sized filters, and I have Baratza Encore (which im considering upgrading with the M2 Burrs very soon out of suspicion that this all may be a grind quality issue). I have a gooseneck kettle too, and an appropriate scale. The only thing im not doing is using specialty water because i am living somewhere with very high water quality, and frankly i really dont want have to spend more money up keeping mineral water, buying plastic water bottles when i have filtered brita water already.

Finally, the coffee im using rotates between mostly quality specialty roasters in Canada, mostly purchasing single origin coffee from Pilot, Quietly, Lüna, Phil &amp; Seb etc.

The problem is that no matter what i do, theres a kind of dry, astringent note that always accompanies my coffees. The notes on the bag barely come through no matter how i manipulate the grind, and though i can sometimes get a pleasant, sweet balanced cup, it is not happening consistently enough, even if i don’t change any of the variables.

I wonder if my palette is just not very good. I have trouble tasting bitterness, and “over extraction ends up just giving me a dry mouth sensation, as if i was having a dry cup of red wine as opposed to giving me a burnt toast kind of sensation. The worst of this problem is that all my coffee has this uniform kind of unpleasant acidic note in the background, no matter the origin or the supposed notes on the bag. Im driving myself nuts trying to figure out what the problem could be.

As a final note, its not like i dont like specialty coffee or even acidic coffees. Though im picky, i have enjoyed plenty of coffees from local cafes, many of which ive tried making using the same beans at home with less than stellar results.

Thank you for your time and reading this rant lol.",1610375830
Coffee,v60 filters - Japan vs Netherlands,"I had no idea that there was such a huge difference between the two filters, but there really is! I ordered filter papers from a new place and when it came, my reaction was like ""I don't recognize this"".

I normally brew 1:16 or 1:17 ratio depending on how much I brew with the Japanese filters, but with the Dutch ones, everything just tasted watery and bad. I had to readjust my grind size and changed ratio to 1:15 to get a decent cup, but it's still nowhere near as good. All with the same beans.

Anyone else felt the same that you had to readjust? Are the Dutch papers a lot thicker or what's going on?",1610375260

After a month it failed.

After pressing start one morning it started to wildly continuously run and dispense water on both the espresso and drip maker. The LED screen flashed non-stop like it was shorting out.

Coffee,"Is it possible to achieve ""coffee shop"" coffee taste in my homemade lattes &amp; cappuccinos?","I have recently bought a mid-range coffee machine, Sage/Breville Barista Express. Trying to learn all the basics of making good coffee at home. Espressos are excellent, however whenever i try to make a latte or cappuccino the taste is not as strong as the taste you get from coffee shop lattes?  


I noticed that most chain coffee shops have very distinct and strong coffee taste, almost artificial taste. However I seem unable to achieve this so far. I have tried supermarket beans to start with and bought some freshly roasted beans and experimenting with those.

&amp;#x200B;

So i was wondering whether it's to do with pressure? e.g. most coffee shops have high level machines and grinders, so in this case it would be hard/impossible to achieve that at home with mid range machine?  


Or whether it's to do with selecting right coffee beans? Should I aim for dark roast only? So far I only had medium and medium-dark roast, as this was recommended in local coffee shop",1610365640

Coffee,[V60] swirling during bloom increasing total brew time,"I've been brewing by /u/kingseven's ultimate V60 technique for a while now and while it has been working out well for me so far, I've recently switched up my coffee a little and tried lighter roast (I prefer medium/lighter generally). For some reason I wasn't able to dial it in correctly, the brews just took soooo long, e.g. 15/250 dose up to 7,5 minutes and 30/500 up to 10!

I ofc tried to compensate this by making the grind coarser, but it made unsurprisingly low impact. (I usually grind 15-17 for 15/250, tried even going to 21 with no significant difference).

What I tried today was after pouring the initial 30g of water, I wouldn't stir but rather gently, but thoroughly mix everything up with a spoon. 

This led to the perfect brew time of 3:40 (on grind setting 15) and me being happy again!

When I took my first sip this morning I felt like a door to coffee opened that I didn’t even know about.

This tea is quite rare, even in japan. So rare, that for some time only one producer was left until the local goverment stepped in with support. So I was quite happy when I found this tea offered at the EU based vendor What-Cha. This way I could avoid problems with german customs. If somebody is interested in more details about the processing of this tea, you can check out this link: [https://www.myjapanesegreentea.com/goishicha](https://www.myjapanesegreentea.com/goishicha)

Upon opening the bag of this tea I was treated with a very strong and unfamiliar smell. It is very hard to discribe, because it is something completly different to other teas and tea types. It has strong fermented notes but coupled with a strong acidic tone to it. It is really unique and interesting but defnetly not something I would like to smell all day. For steeping I heated up my water to boiling temeperature an placed one brick in my 160ml Kyusu and rinsed the tea first. The wet leaves loose their strong smell a bit. The same notes are still there but turned down a bit and coupled with a little sweetness. For my first steep I started with five minutes as recomended by What-Cha

*Processing img dbkjb7mu2ia61...*

*Processing img jr0wxd0x2ia61...*

The color of the liquid is red- brownish orange a bit like amber and smells like the wet leaves but toned down.

The taste was quite a surprise, because it has a strong molass, licorice sweetness. Fermented notes like mushrooms are there but they are not so prominent as in other fermented teas like ripe Pu Erh. It also has a some acidity like a lemon based sourness. This acidity is there but it is not overwhelming the other tasting notes and it gives the tea and its sweetness an interresting kick. For my part I like the little sourness but I can imagine, that some people dont. So for my second infusion I agian brewed the tea with boiling water for five minutes but placed the liquid in the fridge for half an hour until it was cold. I read that this would nullify or heavily turn down the acidity of the tea and it worked. The cold tea kept its sweetness and fermented notes but lacked the acidity nearly completly.

So this is a very unique tea and definitely completly different to any other fermented teas I had in the past. I would definitely recomend to try out this style tea and enjoy it with loved ones for special occasions.",1610285402

I tend to use about 3 and half table spoonfuls for about 400ml of water. For fukamushi this seems maybe a too much. I go for one brew method, brew once and be done with the leaves.

I have done like 3 topics about Fukujirushi, or mentioned about my struggles to brew it. I still had only one good steep from it, where the taste was bitter free, very thick taste, and just overall great cup. After that, i havent come nowhere close to that. I had couple of other problem teas too. Basically, what always or 90% time works well, are cheaper Senchas, and Gyokuros. Baaically everything between seems to end up disappointing.

All help, and tips are welcome. You could also just show me a pic of the leaf amount you use, per the amount of water you use.",1610264862

tea,"Her-cha review pt. 2, green oolong","Green oolong
First brew. No sugar.  
100ml Gaiwan and half the amount in the tin (I don’t have a scale. Sorry.)
Scent is orchid and jasmine like
Brew is a very light green and the scent is grassy
Fairly basic green tea taste. Thick feeling in the mouth. Flowery perfume lingers in the throat. Simple, but pleasant. Not buttery. Leaves have a scent of cut clover flowers

Second steep. 
Deeper green, about the same as the first steep otherwise. Leaves are still opening. 

Third steep + four pieces of rock sugar. Using approx 70ml from now on. 
Yet again little change, there is now a slightly toasted taste which is pleasant. 

Fourth steep + three more small sugars. Two minutes. 
More of a yellow color now. Floral scent is gone. Very sweet taste, not as thick and not buttery. The floral scent from earlier is in this steep even though it’s scent is gone. Not as toasted as the last until it cools some. Largely the same. I almost want it to have toasted rice in it. 

Fifth steep + 1 sugar
Three minutes
Not as pleasant. Feels thin and very one note. This one will go to my orchids. 

Sixth steep + 4 sugar 
Three and a half minutes 
Only has a bit of sweetness from the sugar. Not that pleasant either, though I didn’t expect it to be. The rest of this is for orchids.",1610216351

I ordered 5 lb of assam for kombucha, 5 lb of ceylon for my daily, and several smaller sizes to sample and try. I have always loved tea but have never really tried to brew anything other than average tea. Fancy tea was for fancy tea shops. Quarantine had me missing my fancy tea, but I also had to save money by buying in bulk. After some research, I found herbco. I cannot recommend this site enough! Me and my s/o bought a ton of tea and couldn't be happier with the quality. Granted, we aren't tea experts just tea lovers on a budget. They have dosage, steep, times and temperatures for all of their tea. It's $5.50 for a lb of chinese assam black tea. They have a huge catalog of teas. Shipping can be pricey a bit pricey for smaller amounts. 


I really recommend that you and several friends/family members pick out of some smaller amounts of tea and do a tasting.  We have tried winter blend*, gold rush, tropical, jasmine pearls*, gunpowder green, tripple berry tea, polari-tea*, orange-spice cinnamon, darjeeling, rooibos africana, rooibos chai masala, and cold &amp; flu brew.

* = top 3, no particular order. They're all good though!

My favorite is taking the chocolate herbal chai, simmering it in my soymilk for 30 min, then gently boiling ceylon for the last five minutes. This is the most rich, creamy chai I have ever had! It is almost like dessert. Perfect for snow days or those days where I need a pick me up. It has to be the best tea I have ever had. I've been going to tea shops all over NYC for years and this tea beats 'em all.

tea,"Fixing teapots, Hagi ware and where to buy it","Hi all! I'm going to address a few different things in this post. They are all about Hagi ware. 

Firstly, I encountered a tragedy a few days ago: my Hagi yaki teapot that my partner had gifted me less than a month ago was broken by him (in an accident). There was some luck, and the teapot wasn't damaged that much, it was only the knob on the lid that got broke off. I think it's possible to glue it quite smoothly, but here's where I'm asking your advice. Does anyone know which sort of glue should I go for? Obviously something that is good for ceramics, but what I'm contemplating is the temperature that the glue can stand. So far I've found one that says it's good up to 65C. Maybe I am thinking this too much, but do you think it will be enough? The teapot is primarily used for brewing green tea so it's not like I'm pouring 100C water into it, but I guess the lid still gets a fair amount of heat especially in longer sessions. What do you think? 

If anyone has any stories about breaking precious teaware I could do with some peer support - it sucks that the thing that had to break was the newest, prettiest and most precious both in financial and emotional value.  

Naturally, after this accident I went to the internet to see if I could find a replacement. After some searching I found [this](https://www.tablinstore.info/) store that sells teapots similar to what I have. Do anyone of you have experience ordering from there? It looks reliable to me, but I'm still wondering if it's a trustworthy site selling the ""real deal"" so to speak. I don't know if it's pure madness to even think about getting another kyusu when the one I have will still be probably okay to use, but I grew fond of some of the pots on the site... 

Lastly, when reading about Hagi ware on Wikipedia I learned that its substance is porous and this means the colour of the pot will change in time. I had assumed that since it's glazed it's okay to use it for any tea, but does this mean that one pot should be dedicated to one tea type, as is the case with Yixing teapots? Should I also avoid washing it with soap? In the beginning I brewed some oolong with it and the leaves were left in the pot for some time and the smell stuck, so I washed it with detergent but after that I've only brewed green tea with it. Just wondering if I should keep it strictly green tea pot or is it okay to brew something else every once in a while. 

Thank you to anyone who can answer any of the questions! Hopefully you all have good day and some good tea to enjoy.",1610108252

tea,Just a small warning about ordering from Republic of Tea right now...,"I want to post this here as my first time deciding to switch from matcha &amp; tea bags to loose leaf I searched this sub. Within the sidebar and a post I believe with a comment from a mod, ROT was suggested.

I placed an order for 8 different kinds, qualifying for free shipping. I however wanting it sooner than later so I didn't need to buy more tea locally opted to purchase Priority shipping which should take only 2-3 days.

Maybe this is normal for some companies but not any others I've dealt with (including where I buy my matcha) but apparently they didn't ship anything from the 24th-4th or so meaning now according to their support it'll take at  least around 7 days for anything to ship as they've gotta play catch-up, no matter if you paid extra for faster shipping. No refund either. No warning during checkout. Mind you, I read their shipping page prior to ordering.

For my first experience with them I can't say I'm thrilled. I'd wondered what was up since it has been days since my order so messaged them earlier to receive the above response.

Others here in another thread I made suggested another couple companies I'll definitely be checking out next time. This isn't to knock ROT really though as someone in marketing and sales I find their practice and lack of even a simple warning (and taking extra money for nothing) questionable, this is primarily in mind for others that may find ROT via Reddit as I did and be considering placing an order.",1610064795

tea,total destruction.,"sorry for the dramatic and somewhat ambiguous title. 

well. this year isnt a good start for me. i have not only - in the past four weeks - destroyed the lid of my expensive yixing but also broke a teacup and the lid of my gaiwan.
im just a disaster.
thinking of new ways to bridge the way from my tea setup to the kitchen. gonna put it in a basket with pillows inside. so even if i drop the basket they should not shatter 😭😭😭

anyways. since i only have half of a gaiwan and teapot left i thought it should be more common to trade half of teaware.
im sure some of you have broken a similar sized gaiwan and were left with the lid. but yeah sizes and forms differ i knooooow. could be measured ofc.

anyways. mostly just wanted to rant before figuring out where to get a new gaiwan.

For starters, I'm not a tea expert at all (being a broke student doesn't help). A few days ago I purchased some fermented puerh tea, most definitely not the best quality (loose leaves from a Spanish brand and it cost me €10 for 100g) but that's what I could afford.

The tea came in a resealable paper bag and the first brew was actually great, with a very strong flavour. I got about 3-4 brews from those same leaves and all were great. From then on, the tea has...lost its taste? No matter how much tea I use, what water I use, what method I use, it always tastes like hot water. I was actually scared I'd got Covid but I can taste and smell anything else just fine. 

Maybe I left the bag open or didn't reseal it too well? I just can't understand why the first leaves were so tasty and then boom, just coloured hot water. As for storage, I've kept in in the bag it came in, mostly away from light and heat. What could have happened here?",1609974684

I want to boil 200ml for 2 infusions, otherwise I waste the other 300ml of precious filtered water (stopped re-boiling because of developping bad/bland taste). But I also want to have either temperature regulator or at least a temperature indicator so I can see the temp before pouring into the gaiwan. 150-250ml would be perfect, but I can live with 300ml minimum as well. 

Russell Hobbs Inspire has 235ml minimum which is good, but no temperature indicator. I don't know if anything bad will happen with the kettle if I boil 200ml instead of the minimum of 500ml but I guess so. And I would want to boil faster - the RHI is a slow kettle, but if the only small temp measuring kettle is a slow one... I think I would buy it anyway.

I'll typically do about 4/5 steeps at a time to myself sometimes even 6. My question now is am I over consuming? As I see most people who do gong fu brewing use these teeny tiny cups which I simply cannot be bothered for, I feel like maybe this style of brewing just isn't the most practical when I just want something hot to sip whilst I'm working during the day. Does anyone else do solo gong fu style brewing the way I do or am I alone here? I feel like wirh gong fu style brewing it's just so easy to consume a large amount of caffeine/tea when you are so accustomed to western style, I've had a couple restless nights where I couldn't sleep properly and my gut was telling me it could have possibly been due to consuming alot of tea those days, I now don't consume any past 4pm.",1609930375

I tried a sample I got that's from a compressed cake twice now and feel it didn't turn out well either time. First attempt I had 2 primary chunks around 5grams, so 2x 2.5g. This was better than the 2nd attempt when I used 1x 5g chunk. Should I be aiming to use a single large chunk or multiple smaller pieces? 

I watched some videos and some people suggested letting the tea sit for 5-7 minutes after rinsing to let it open up because that seems to be my biggest issue. Even letting it sit after a rinse didn't really open it up. I'll brew 3-4 times with it still compressed and I feel it turns out very watered down and unenjoyable compared to a loose leaf brew that feels perfect from the first brew on. 

I just bought like 4 cakes, so this is quite disappointing since cakes seem to be all the rage. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but these just turn out so much less enjoyable than loose leaf tea that it's almost a complete turn off.",1609849844

The most ""Green Tea"" that i can buy in stores ( even expensive ones ) from normal stores, tea stores or chinese/asian stores is mostly bitter and doesnt taste anywhere near that stuff that i got gifted.

My research till now shows that this is some kind of Oolong Tea (not green tea?!?) from China. But the Brand ""Zhong Min Hong Tai"" is not sold in germany or europe. And it is grown in the An-xi region of China’s Fujian province.

Now there are several stores that sell ""Tie Guan Yin"" from this area ranging from 12-16€ per 100gr. and i have no idea if these are comparable to the one from ""Zhong Min Hong Tai"" or if they are bad too :D should i just order from one of these stores and try it?

tea,Few stupid questions about brewing,"I see people talking about doing a session, what is this and how would you brew for it - I imagine it involves a teapot and a mesh ball?

I have bought a (probably gimmicky, but I like it) glass jug with mesh strainer from Brew Tea Co. It says its a teapot for 1 but it brews 400ml of tea with the leaves directly in the water so it needs pouring out to prevent over extraction. 

I struggle to believe that 400ml is a tea for one as most tea cups appear to come in sizes ranging from 200ml to 350ml. As such I am currently brewing my 'tea for one' and decanting it into what is essentially a sports direct mug - not quite the 'fine tea' experience I was hoping for.

In light of this, should I have bought a classic tea pot like a brown betty and a mesh ball on a stick with some actual fine tea cups?

Finally I bought some 'breakfast tea' with my fancy, gimmicky strainer jug and it seems like it was a pointless exercise as its no better than a twinings assam teabag. However, the earl grey is fantastic so I guess loose leaf tea is for finer / flavoured teas. 

The cauldron ceramics site has something about the design of the teapot allowing the leaves to swirl around inside it but with a 1L teapot this seems like a one way ticket to over extracted tea?

I have a reasonable order from Whittards coming with Oolongs etc that I'm excited to try. But i'm just not completely sold on my brewing vessel currently.

So I just bought a yixing clay pot for the first time from the website Teewald, which is based in germany. I found that they have good and solid looking teas and teawares, and after a recommendation I thought to try it out.
Im just getting in to pu erh tea, and what better way Is there to drink said tea than with a yixing clay pot.
I bought a yixing zini xishi for 59€
I found the price to be very good and the pictures looked quite good, so I ordered it.
After diving deeper in to the world of yixing ware I found a person who was saying that you really shouldn't be buying yixing pots under 100€ because there's a good chance it might be fake.
Now I googled for ways to find out if your pot is authentic. I tested it for color, coarseness, smell, that crackling sound when poured over with hot water and that water droplet thingy.
It all tells me that its authentic. But how do I really know, and would Teewald- a good renowned big website in Germany fake their info?
If someone can help me in any way I'd be really glad!

Coffee,Moving from French press to pour over. Any advice?,"Hey everybody! My wife is a huge advocate of easy coffee. For that reason, she typically always uses our drip coffee maker since its easy for her; however, the drip maker recently broke and I'd really like to get the thing off our counter for good. For the past several years, I've had an Espro French press that I typically used almost exclusively for making small batches of cold brew. Recently, we've been using this on a daily basis to make hot coffee and it's both time consuming and annoying to clean up. The reason I actually originally invested in the French press was because it could serve dual purpose in that it could do cold brew and hot. That being said, for simplicity, I was thinking of investing in a pour over coffee setup instead of replacing our drip coffee maker. Is there something out there that will make enough coffee for the two of us (we generally each have 2 somewhat large cups per day) that isn't difficult to make and is easy to clean up?

I was looking at the Hario V60-02 since it's the larger of the 2 models, but after purchasing everything (the V60 + the carafe + the filters + I will need a gooseneck kettle) I'm already up in the hundreds on Amazon.

I have owned a Keurig machine for about a decade and before I became an aspiring coffee snob, I LOVED it! 

Now that I’m grinding my own coffee and using an Aeropress, I can’t tolerate it at all. It tastes like water mixed with used and molded coffee grinds! 

About once a week, however, I don’t have time to go through the ritual and I’m forced to fire up the Keurig. I am forced to add oat milk, which hides the awfulness, but it’s still extremely unenjoyable. 

But... 

Keurig cups are vacuum sealed. This, in theory, could keep them more fresh than a pre-ground bag that sits in the supply chain for weeks or months before arriving to your kitchen. 

Keurig has a tiny computer that checks water temp that could, in theory, heat the water to exactly 205 degrees Fahrenheit- or whatever the best heat is. 

Keurig has a tiny computer that pours out the water. This could, in theory, pour at some scientifically proven best rate. 

So... why is Keurig so goddamn awful? Is there a super fancy one out there that accounts for all these factors? Am I sitting on a million dollar idea that I just gave away to complete strangers?

I fully cleaned the grinder, including taking the grinder apart and vacuuming to remove any debris, but it would still not turn even when pushing the button inside the grinder itself. 

I talked with Breville Customer Service and they said they will fix it but it will be about $240. I am now left with two options, to either get it fixed or get a new separate grinder. 

Has anyone had this issue and attempted to fix it themselves? Again I have tried everything in the manual and from videos online to clean the grinder but to no success. The only thing I haven't tried is to take the machine apart.

Last night she told me “I just don’t have the palate, or the patience to really know the difference in why coffee is better or worse. But I know you do, so I want to you to pick one that you’d be happy using too.” 

For reference, I just bought an encore grinder. And daily use chemex/v60/French press depending on what I’m wanting that day. And she’s perfectly content with Starbucks pike pre ground in the mr coffee.

She really wants something that’s at least somewhat multi functional, and in her research landed on the ninja machines that are on the home drip machine list. From what I’ve seen, those tend to break a little more often and aren’t as consistent as some of the others?

So the breville and moccamasters look like they’re the most recommended. And the breville precision seems to be somewhat multifunctional. But, is there anything else I should be looking at? And if not, why exactly are these the best options vs the ninja that she’s looked at?

Thanks y’all!",1610295235

Coffee,Tasting coffee is harder than I thought.,"I've been trying to get into coffee past few months and got my first grinder like month or two ago. I realized that to get most out of it, I have to be able to adjust it right. And to do that I have to be able to taste what is wrong in the cup in the first place.

Today I did a small test or tasting. I brewed two small cups of filter coffee, one with coarsest grind I got out from my grinder and another one with the finest grind. My goal was to find out how over extracted coffee tastes like and vice versa how under extracted coffee tastes like.

Once I got all set up and started slurping, at first I couldn't tell what the difference between the two cups was. They pretty clearly tasted different, but I couldn't tell myself what the difference was. As the cups cooled down tasting got easier.

Still pretty much all I learned from this was what the ""bitter"" meanswhen talking about over extracted coffee. I couldn't 
distinguish any clear tastes from the under extracted version. Again I tasted something, but I didnt't find any words for it. Maybe it was too coarse so there really wasn't much to taste.

I think I'll try this again some day, but go less extreme with the grind settings. Maybe it would be easier to taste then.

I have no guestions or anything here, I just wanted to share this small adventure about my first steps in the world of coffee and maybe provoke some conversation. Thanks for reading through!",1610282890

* Inverted method, no bloom
* 14g - 200g (96 deg C)
* 3 stirs initially
* 1 min brew + 30 min push
* 3 more stirs before push

Coffee,Beginner aeropress home brewer needs some help with recipe,"Hello all,

Since all the cafes I used to get coffee from are shut down due to the pandemic I decided to get an aeropress and the beans these shops use and try out home brewing. The first few cups I made were borderline undrinkable but I could always figure out what I was doing wrong (too fine grind, too high water temp etc). I've managed to consistently produce OK cups that aren't really that good :( 

This is the recipe I use:

.Inverted method

.16g beans

.Medium-fine grind - 5 clicks clockwise using the rhinoware hand grinder

.195F water

.Add 100g water and stir x5

.Add 140g water

.Brew for 1:50

.Invert and press

Coffee,Atlas Burundi Coffee tastes burnt,"My wife bought me a membership to Atlas Coffee Club of the Month. My first bag was a Burundi Kayanza and I was excited to try it out. I made a pourover using 16:1 ratio, which normally makes an excellent cup of coffee. 

When I sipped it, I immediately had flashbacks of the last time I drank a Pikes Place from Starbucks. I decided to give the beans a few days because the roast was fairly recent, then I tried again and got the same result. I've played with the ratio (15:1, 17:1) and it tastes like burnt rubber.

Coffee,French press sensitivity?,"   I've been a fan of coffee for many years now but I was becoming dissatisfied with coffee machines of all sorts and I decided I wanted something more manual. I invested in a french press, and I love it! I grind my beans myself, and I think the coffee tastes much better that way. It's a more meaningful experience altogether.

However, since getting one I've been feeling a bit odd, and I think it may have to do with the coffee. I've been a bit lightheaded or ""off-balance"" and my anxiety has been higher, not mentally as much as physically (ex. sweating more, heart beating a little faster). I am drinking a little more coffee than before, but it seems like even after one mug I begin experiencing these symptoms, and I've never felt that way before.

I didn't think it was the coffee until I had my second cup one afternoon and noticed the symptoms that had been minimal all day suddenly return.

Is there something different about french press coffee that may be causing this? Is it increased caffiene intake? Something I'm doing wrong? 

Thanks all",1610232321
Coffee,Help with Breville Barista Express,"Hi Everyone,

For Christmas I bought our family a Breville Barista express and I am having a little trouble dialing in my shots. For the first bag I bought from a local roaster and the espresso was really good. In my opinion it had nice balance and good pressure and timing. For my next bag of beans is when I started having some issues. I bought a bag of Partners flatiron coffee from Whole Foods and it was roughly a week after the roast date. The coffee tasted terrible, it was either bitter or sour and the only way I could drink it was with plenty of milk. I then bought two bags of stumptown. One was the Holler Mountain and the other was their Hairbender. Again both of these had very either bitter or sour results and I couldn’t taste any of the flavors that were described on their bag. 

I am doing roughly 17/18 gram doses and grinding on the finest setting on my Breville. I have a distributor and a tamper that’s set to 30lbs of pressure. The pressure gauge is in the correct zone around 12 o’clock. I am also unsure of when to start timing myself but from the first drips to a 1:2 ratio takes about 28 ish seconds. I still can’t get anything drinkable without putting a bunch of milk in it. I am not sure what I am doing wrong when my first experience was relatively pleasant. I appreciate any tips you guys would be able to give me. Thanks!",1610231854

Coffee,Getting more flavour clarity in my brew?,"I'm \_fairly\_ new to the whole coffee game and wonder what I can do to improve the clarity of my flavours on this new coffee that is baffling me a little. 

It comes from a roastery with a good reputation (Obadiah in Edinburgh) and is a costa rican honey processed cattura/catuai filter roast. The flavor notes say ""honeydew, pecan and maple syrup"". 

I use a Comandante grinder, currently at 25 clicks and an Aeropress. The recipe is 14g of coffee to 200g of water (93 Degrees), Tim Wendelboe's Recipe. (Stir, sit 1 minute, stir again, press). The water is bottled and has a pretty low TDS count (can't tell exactly right now). 

Now when the coffee is cooled down quite a bit i can easily get the honeydew melon. But apart from that the coffee feels fairly flat and yeah, there's this pecan-maple-something lingering around, but I just really have the feeling that i could do \_something\_ to get those flavours out more distinctly.

Coffee,Extremely bitter yet fast espresso shot,"Hello,

I received a PID for my Gaggia Classic and tried my first shot with it. While it was the cleanest shot I've ever made (no coffee spilled everywhere through the naked PF), but I got ~2x yield (18 in, 38 out) in 20 seconds and it tasted bitter as hell.

From my understanding of the [espresso compass](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/the-espresso-compass/) it means that I'm over-extracting and should decrease yield. But if I do that, my time variable will move as well and I will end up with a 15 seconds shots, so I am a bit lost.

What variable should I change to try to improve my espresso?

Setup :

* Gaggia Classic 2012 with PID + Pre-infusion (1.5s pre-infusion + 2.5s delay before actually pulling the shot)
* Niche Zero on 10
* VST 18g basket + Naked PF
* 58mm coffee distribution tool + 58.6mm tamper

I don't know if it counts, but I tamped as hard as I could to make one less variable to worry about from shot to shot.",1610225423

If you love tea in any other extent or fashion, e.g. as an occasional or maybe even everyday companion, but striving consistently for the most researched, authentic tasting experience is not your main concern, then please click away, this post is not meant for you: there are many other ways to obtain decent water for your brews, that are much more environmentally and practically sustainable, than buying expensive and hard-to-come-by, fine-tea-enhancing bottled water.*

\*\*\* RE-POSTING \*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

What water do you use with your special eastern teas? Do you avoid bottled water on principle?

If you do, the reason might be related with caring about the environment: I can relate with that. But when it comes to water and fine eastern tea, bad water kills the brew and my pleasure in drinking it, so I wonder: what is the point of looking for high quality, delicate leaves? That is a topic that puzzles me greatly, for the extent that its importance is underrated and casually disregarded among eastern tea enthusiasts and vendors alike.

Brewed tea is more than 99% water, and water interacts and bonds in a complex way with the tea compounds at a chemical level. It stands to logic that an essential part of the flavour of the final brew will depend on the quality of the water you used. For example, did you ever read anything about something called '***tea creaming***'? In short, it is a phenomenon that occurs when minerals in water aggregate the aromatic particles of tea into bigger molecules, that are not any more perceivable by our senses: in other words, water that is more mineral than let's say \~60 mg/l (a personal estimate based on years of experiments), not only it has a strong taste that may conceal, alter or cloud part of the goodness of tea, but it --literally-- **deprives the tea of its aromatic compounds** **(by precipitation)**, lowering *significantly* the number of “tasty” molecules that we can perceive. Does it make sense to you, buying carefully-made, highly expensive tea, to only perceive (and enjoy) half of its taste because of the wrong water?

But good water is so much more than the TDS value. It is a delicate balance between the individual quantities of the most important ions that influence flavour. In particular, calcium \[CA++\] (sweet, umami, earthy), magnesium \[MG++\] (bitter-sweet), sodium \[Na+\] (salty, bitter), potassium \[K+\] (sweet / salty, bitter), bicarbonates \[HCO3--\] (salty, alkaline, limy), sulphates \[SO4--\] (salty, rancid), chloride \[CL-\] (salty), silica \[SiO2\] (sweet).

Traditional water filters are not a good alternative medium to achieve tea-suitable water. They use two main mechanisms: ionic exchange and activated charcoal. Ionic exchange usually gives back two molecules of sodium for every calcium molecule it takes: that’s it. Involved ions may differ, but the idea is always the same: it is an *exchange*. Activated charcoal mostly filters organic compounds, not minerals. Both methods do very little to alter the balance of most of the other ions.

Inverted osmosis and other more advanced means of filtering, like ZeroWater filters, are certainly a better option, if you want to avoid bottles at all cost. But these methods of purification cannot differentiate between useful and non-useful ions: they filter acritically. Most importantly, they filter too much, for the purpose of tea brewing: resulting water has a TDS that is close to zero (it is almost a distilled water). Beside, both are quite expensive. Ultimately, if the source water is not good, it may end up being significantly less bad, but that does not mean that it will became a water that is suitable for tea. Acritically filtered water has no character and it lacks the balanced edges that good tea requires.

That is the scientific side.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing gif c2u0yv2hkw861...*

From a humanistic perspective, in a way, tea is a celebration of water. Just think about the aesthetic and the cultural context behind the practices of 工夫茶 and 茶の湯. It may sound silly, but through tea I fell in love with water and its sounds. I rediscovered that which I used to pay too little attention about: the beauty implicit into something so ordinary. Remarkably, I was reminded of the importance of water and of fighting for the environment that keeps it clean, in every other way that is available to me. I use magnesium BWT filters for drinking and cooking, and I try to do my part everyday, buying locally sourced, zero waste and organic as much as I can; recycling properly (glass and plastic bottles are easy to re-use and to recycle efficiently), using public transportation, not owning a car, paying for energy produced from renewable sources. If I take that into account, I believe I can still make a difference. Sometime, the ethical perspective needs to consider the aesthetic and strive to find a balance with it, otherwise life becomes merely functional, mechanical. Of all the possible reasons for using bottled water, preparing authentic eastern tea is the reasonable one for me. I believe something is lost in undermining the importance of prioritizing beauty, for a few things that you really love and that make you a better person: beauty is the reason the world deserves to be saved, and too often we forget to keep that goal **connected with the means we use to achieve it**. Tea culture and tea drinking help with that connection, if we let them. That is why it is called mindfulness.

My advice is not: use bottled water for your top quality teas. My advice is a little more complex than that, and it is rooted in the idea of self-made experience. Learning about water influenced my love of tea and changed my experience with it. So I am writing: please experiment with it, **before** choosing. Question your decision of avoiding bottled water for tea with an open mind to make a personal but **-informed-** decision. Find and buy a couple of bottles of a water that is great for tea: **TDS between 20 and 60 mg/l, slightly acidic PH, hardness &lt;3°F, possibly poor in bicarbonates and rich in magnesium, calcium and silica**. Now try brewing a wide range of authentic, excellent eastern teas that you love in two teapots, maintaining the exact same parameters, but using the bottled water in the first, and the tap water you normally use, in the second. Wait, then possibly try again with a different kind of tea, until you sampled at least all the main categories. After that, if you find that the difference is something you can do without, or if you think the impact of your using plastic bottles is going to nullify every other effort you can make for the environment, or if you think that your tap water brew still honours the effort that tea makers put into crafting your special teas, then please stay with it! I shall happily rest my case, but at least you will base your decision on your own research and experience.

I know it loses between 5-10C every hour depending on how much water is in it (and the starting temp) so I usually adjust brewing time to accommodate that.

I am starting to log my tea-drinking but rarely measure water temp before I brew and I thought 'it would it be great to have a Thermos jug that could tell you the temp before you poured' (instead of having to open the jug and measure the water with a thermometer every time) and lo, I found out temperature display insulated bottles exist.

However, they appear to be sold by electronics companies rather than reputable brands that sell insulated products (think Zojirushi, Thermos etc) and I haven't seen any that go above 525ml.

Coffee,I just made one of the best cups I've brewed when I messed up my Tetsu Kasuya 4:6 method,"For the record, I actually brew V60 with Hoffmann's method, but decided I'd take another shot at the 4:6 method (I don't particularly have good results with it in the past, always thought they taste weak).

I made a smaller dose of 13g:200ml of my washed light roast Ethiopian. Grind size, I'd say is medium. Decided to do 30:50:40:40:40 with 40 sec timings. Idk, maybe it's the morning buzz of I am just out of my headspace, but I thought I was timing at 40 sec intervals but I actually was doing 20 secs. I only realized it at the last pour.

Lo and behold, it was a very balanced cup with a pleasant acidity and no bitterness at all. And it doesn't taste weak. I think I like it even more than the Hoffmann method brews. 

Just thought I'd share my sweet serendipity with you guys. Cheers.",1610213377

Coffee,Help! I can't make coffee!,"I feel really dumb for making this post but my parents got me a standard one-cup coffee maker for Christmas and every cup it produces is pretty lackluster.

So I would much rather have iced coffee and I do drink it often ( I buy the Starbucks iced coffee blonde roast and it's perfect ), but sometimes I enjoy a hot cup. So I have fresh flavored light roast coffee, and I measured out two tablespoons of grounds, added 6 oz of water ( I had a small mug and it fit fine ). Brewed it on bold because the instructions said use Bold if you're using flavored grounds. The cup ends up being much less water than I initially put in. I assume cause it's soaked up in the grounds? I added creamer, and it's just...not good. It's almost salty. 

So I guess I'm just looking for answers I'm sure you pros already know lol. Do I add more water next time? Do I try to brew it on the regular setting and not bold? I literally cannot screw this up but somehow I am. I used to brew coffee in a mini teapot in my younger years and never had any issues so it's driving me mad! Lol

Alone, the Colombian coffees, I have drank recently, have not been as bad as the adjectives I use - they are okay coffees and I could drink them if that is all there was, but in comparison to Ethiopian coffees, I find those adjectives in contrast.

(I seem to remember hearing about a women run collective in Ethiopia, but that's the only example I can think of off the top of my head). Then, even when I look at a random sample of the businesses I use, or that they say they use, there's just more men, especially at the top.

Coffee,Strange experience with Starbucks blonde espresso roast,"Hi people.   


I'm usually into freshly roasted coffee but we had guests who like really classic grocery store type of coffee so I went and bought some starbucks blonde espresso roast, not expecting much.   
Such a weird experience with this one.   
It brews pretty good in a Moka Pot and decently in a Aeropress. Really balanced, like really realy - it looks like it is pretty hard ot mess it up. Also pretty flat as a taste - good but super flat and without anything going on (which is also not that bad).   
What surprised me the most tho is that the one I got was relatively old - it was brewed a few months ago, but it kept its taste for thru the 2 weeks i've been drinking it.   
So yeah - pretty weird coffee - classic taste, super flat, but somehow durable (for lack of a better word).

Coffee,Tips for creating faux-espresso/expresso-like coffee at home,"Hi all,

So up front, I can't afford an espresso machine, nor do I think, at this point in my life, that it'd be a good buy. My husband isn't a huge fan of coffee and truthfully I'm not sure if I have the patience and time to spend on creating espresso at home. I toyed with a Nespresso for a while, but I just can't get behind the disposable pods even though they're recyclable (or Néstle).

But that said, I'm really missing espresso-based drinks (latté, cappuccino, flat white) and would love to make something similar at home. Doesn't have to be true espresso, but anything that can get me close to that.

I've tried the Moka pot and french press milk frother route, but it's been difficult. I have a crap Moka pot I bought at a garage sale for $5, and doing the milk frother in the french press always makes a mess and the whole thing takes forever.

I'm leaning towards a new Moka pot and buying a milk frother. Any thoughts on that, or other avenues? Any tips for making Moka pot coffee actually taste good? I'd say our budget is around $150 CAD (but could go higher if cost/benefit is there).

I am looking at Amazon's own brand Amazon Brand - Happy Belly Ground Coffee and looked at the espresso one in particular, but the comments are all saying the grind is VERY Fine.

Does anyone have experience with amazzons own coffee and which one works well with DIY pods?

I have a nespresso vertuo next if that's any help

Coffee,Need help with sage barista express (newbie),"Hello everyone  


I recently bought sage barista express, so for first two weeks I was using supermarket beans, illy and starbucks and some random brand. It was very easy to dial in with them, i sticked to 3-5 grind setting and usually had to increase the dose and give a good tamp, my pressure was pretty much always in ""Perfect range"" and timing was good, also the yield and taste was perfect.  


After 2 weeks of doing good coffee with supermarket beans i decided to buy some ""Premium beans"" that are freshly roasted, bought some medium-dark roast and now have absolute nightmare trying to dial.  


At low grind setting 3-5, and normal 18g dose and good tamp, pressure would skyrocket and extraction would be really slow and coffe ends up thick.  


With higher grind setting 8-10, if i use same dose of 18g and give a good tamp, it's  the same. If i decrease the dose and dont tamp as hard the pressure goes to higher end of ""espresso range"" and extraction is very fast, also the auto mode no longer gives 30-40g, the yield has increased to like 100-150g lol, i never reprogrammed it? Also i tried resetting to default settings and it's the same, the yield is super high.  


  
Any advices?",1610131587
Coffee,I do not drink any sort of caffeine but even 10mg of caffeine makes me feel more hyper. 30mg leads me to feel overwhelming hyper and a cup of coffee makes me so hyper that I cant focus on anything and potentially leads to a panic attack. But I've been reading how other people barely feel any effects,"I'm not sure if its a placebo or it varies person to person or what. I have loved coffee all my life and have never been ""addicted"" to it but have had periods where I've indulged daily. I could easily stop  drinking it and go back to it all throughout high school with no problem. Then I had my first panic attack on caffeine and haven't been the same since. After that, i would ""feel"" the effects of the coffee when it used to just be unnoticeable. Even if i drank a cup of cold brew at 4pm, i would sleep fine and feel totally normal.

&amp;#x200B;

But ever since that day, I've had caffeine effect me more and more intensely every time i try to go back to it. As in, ill try some for a few days, the stress and mental effects will be too much then ill stop. This occurred for about a year until i had another panic attack after trying a cup of coffee. This one ended my caffeine intake altogether and i am currently in the works of fixing the anxiety but it is still there. I don't know if the anxiety is the reason im feeling the caffeine so much.

&amp;#x200B;

So today, i only have dark chocolate as a source of caffeine and i can ""feel"" the effects of that with even one square of it. 3 squares feel like a cup of coffee. I really want to get back into drinking coffee but am afraid i will just experience the same cycle again. I don't know why i feel caffeine so much when I've read articles like this [this](https://www.businessinsider.com/i-drank-5-cups-of-coffee-after-a-huge-break-2016-8#my-takeaway-6) where she says she doesn't even feel the effects of caffeine after 3 months of 0 intake. How is it even possible that caffeine feels like meth to me? I just miss the days where i could drink it and not feel this overwhelming mental effect and then crash hard 4 hours later. Not to mention the intense anxiety. Has anyone ever experienced anything similar?",1610130664

Coffee,Coffee Beans too big for Ode Grinder?,"This morning I got up, excited for my first morning brew with my new coffee grinder and the fresh beans I bought yesterday from Quaila Coffee here in DC. I started the kettle and carefully measured out my 30 grams of beans, put them in the hopper, and pressed the on button. To my surprise, and disappointment, none of the beans fed into the burrs and it ran for several seconds before the auto shutoff was triggered. I jostled the beans a bit in hopes I could clear a blockage, started the machine, and again nothing happened. After a few more attempts at poking and prodding the feeder with a chop stick, I gave up and took out as many beans as I could from the hopper and had to send the beans in 3 or 4 at a time to actually get captured by the feeder. A 20 second task turned into a frustrating 15 minute task. Yesterday afternoon, I also purchased some decaf beans so I could test out the grinder. I had no problem with those beans but I did see there is a noticeable size difference between the decaf and regular beans (decaf was smaller but neither look abnormally small or large). Has anyone else experienced this problem with their Ode? Is it possible that it only accepts beans under a certain size? Maybe it is user error but I can’t imagine what I could be doing wrong.

I went into this purchase well aware of the mediocre reviews but I was willing to deal with quirks for the aesthetic, small footprint, and the pour over focused features. This issue doesn't seem like just a quirk. I did not have a grinder prior to this so this was a huge upgrade from getting my beans ground at the coffee shop. I am going to do my own troubleshooting of course but I wanted to see if anyone has recommendations or experience with this issue.

My emails have all been kindly worded to them, but the lack of an explanation is concerning.  I know with Covid, holidays, etc, they've had delays (which is why I waited a full week before emailingeven though their website says they're still getting out in 3 days) .  But, even with delays, I would think I could get an email explanation of some sort other than ""we'll send this to someone who can help"".

Since it's winter here in Wisconsin this  one seems the most important at the moment. The nitrogen in coffee is great as a deicer.

If you like fishing toss a scoop of coffee grounds in with your bait to keep them alive longer.

You can add grounds when making a homemade candle to get a natural coffee scent.

Make sure grounds are fully dried and use in a sugar scrub.

Throw them your compost bin or apply directly to plants.

Coffee,Using the Hoffman V60 method with Moccamaster,"I (finally) got a V60 and have been thoroughly enjoying Hoffman's ultimate method for my afternoon cup, which made me wonder if I could do something similar in the moccamaster for my morning batch brew.


The answer is yes, and it's fantastic. I wanted to share my adaptation :


Beans: Crimson Cup Wayfarer
Grind: 20 on Virtuoso
Water: Kroger spring water


47g beans
750ml (6 cup mark) water


1. Make a little well in the grounds with your fingers

2. Start the moccamaster

3. Once all the grounds are wet, swirl the basket until it looks nice and even

4. When about half the water is gone, swirl again

5. When all the water is gone from the reservoir, stir 1.5 times clockwise and once counterclockwise with a spoon (get to the bottom), wait 5 or 10 seconds, and swirl one last time

6. When the water starts to drip into the carafe, close the valve on the reservoir to stop the flow and enjoy

I was planning on doing concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 mg/mL.

If I use tea bags, I am going to have to change the amount of water I'm using instead of the amount of tea leaves because there is a set amount of leaves in each bag. To do a concentration of 30 mg/mL, I need to brew tea with about 2 ounces of water. While I might be able to get it to be submerged, I'm afraid that there won't be enough water or space for the leaves to expand and the nutrients and polyphenols to be fully released. 

If I were to attempt to change this, adding two tea bags to change the amount of water won't solve the problem. The ratio still has to be the same and the ratio of tea leaves to water is what is causing the issue.

I pretty much want a boiler below $120, 99€ and £90 that can go into specific temperatures instead of presets. I'm assuming that this is what most people here do but if there's a better way of doing it other than heating water on a stovetop with a thermometer, I'd consider it.

In Chinese tea, if I am talking about ""Long jing""/""Dragon Well"", it's a region in China and also I can expect similar flavor green tea no matter the brand because there is similar process people follow to produce dragon well green tea.

tea,What actually happens when you age oolong or black tea?,"The aging of puer tea is talked about a lot and there seems to be a lot of consensus that the ""aging"" process is as a result of a combination of oxidation and microbial activity.


There also seems to be a decent amount of consensus (even if the aging process is not as developed) that for white tea the aging process is essentially a a result of oxidation.


But I am quite interested in what happens when oolongs and black teas are aged. 


Aging of oolongs seems to be relatively established but I can't find any explanation of what the ""aging"" actually involves - presumably it is not microbial activity given the general recommendation is that oolongs should be kept dry and cool whilst aging. Similarly, surely it can't be oxidation as the ""kill the green"" process in oolongs should stop this (unlike white tea or raw puer). Does anyone therefore know what the aging mechanism is or is it a mystery?


There also seem to be increasing numbers of vendors selling compressed black tea - mainly sun-dried Yunnan black tea. I have seen previous discussions here that aging there could be a result of further oxidation as with white tea, but could it also be the same as whatever process causes oolong aging? There seems to be some suggestion that aging could improve even non sun dried black tea - e.g. this aged black tea on teadb doesn't seem to be from Yunnan although I am not sure about its processing: https://teadb.org/2009-haoxin-hongcha-red-black-tea-episode-331/",1609329991

Coffee,Hario Skerton Pro / Timemore C2- Thoughts?,"Looking to get a grinder as a gift for my partner. Having read the brief guide on here that mentioned the Hario Skerton grinders and the online hype over thr Timemore C2 I thought they would be a good starting point. I did look at amazon reviews for similarly priced electric grinders which were positive but I get the impression at my budget a manual grinder would produce better results. We only drink 1 cup each a day so don't need to bulk grind. 

The Hario is a bit cheaper and I think I prefer the glass aesthetic however I hoped some of you may have experience of both. 

The main coffee style would be pour over using a bodum pour over Maker but we also have a duo temp Pro which I use. 

Are either of them capable of pour over and espresso grinds? The main factor would be coarser as it is a gift for someone that uses a pour over maker most of the time but if either would be suitable for dual use that would be ideal. 

If you have a view if there is a better option for around the same price which is £40-£60 please let me know why not just a model name as I will end up back here with more questions.

Coffee,Troubleshooting a bitter cold brew,"Hi all, I just started diving into cold brew and would like to seek help for those who are using [Hario Filter-in Coffee bottle](https://global.hario.com/pickup_fic_m.html) along with the given recipe. 

TL:DR - 50g beans, 750g water (inclusive of filter and grounds weight), 18 hours - turned out bitter. (question below)

Beans used: Brazil Cerrado, medium-dark, 50g (roasted 2 days ago)

Grinder: Timemore C2, 24 clicks

Water: Filter water, room temperature

Process: Grinded beans fresh and put all into filter. Poured water in through the filter with a bit of time in between to let the beans soak through. I didn't measure the amount of water but the water level reached the approx 750ml mark (inclusive of the weight from grounds and filter)

At the 10th hour mark, I took a small sip (by opening the cap and not pouring through the grounds) and found the taste to be weird (there was a weird aftertaste that i couldn't describe as bitter so decided to deem it acidic - it didn't taste chocolately at all). I put in back into the fridge thinking it might be underextracted.

At the 12th hour mark, I took another sip (similiar method) and still had the same issue with the taste.

Had to go out for appointment and when i got back at around the 18th hour mark, I took out the filter, gave the bottle a good shake and drank a mouthful. Taste was woody with aftertaste, but still no chocolately flavor.

Question: I would like to fix it but unsure where to start.

Thinking if i should adjust the following while keeping everything else the same and test at 8, 12 and 16th hour (stopping at whichever is flavourful or woody)

1) Increase the grind to medium-coarse (20 clicks?) 

2) Add 5g of grounds but stick to the same grind

Any other suggestions or analysis is greatly welcome. 

Thanks!",1610102007

Also, in that vein, my all-time fav coffee seems to just taste better with a blade grinder!

Coffee,The Great V60 Mystery,"I wanted to see if this community could help solve this mystery that has stumped me and my friend. Below is a photo I received from a different, mutual friend who had had just finished a V60 pour-over (with an adorable special edition bleached lovebird filter ftr) and it has us flabbergasted as to *what exactly had transpired here*. I don't know anything about this friend's technique, and I honestly can't even think of what they could be doing to cause the filter to look like that. This is not intended to shame this person in any way (they know I'm posting this), but merely to try and solve this coffee crime. Anyway, without further ado, here's the photo:

Also, yes, I've looked into my local coffee shops, and I've been getting beans from a local for over a year. The convenience of having things shipped to my door is definitely appealing to me, vs. having to drive 15 minutes each way to pick it up (they don't deliver yet).

[The ones on the right](https://christopherbean.com/winter-wonderland/) are from a ""specialty"" coffee site where they don't even roast the beans until you order, and they did take a while to even ship so I believe that much. They list the roast temperature (425 F for those), the region (South America, but they didn't list the country?), the altitude they were grown, etc. so I thought ""hey they must be legit"" but idk if maybe it's just because of my lack of coffee knowledge.  
[The ones on the left](https://store.coffeebean.com/products/peru-organic-coffee) are from a brand that sells on Amazon but also have their own site (I bought them off Amazon), so I have no idea when the beans were roasted, but they said they were grown in Peru and that's pretty much the only information they provide.   
The left beans had more flavor and complexity than the right ones despite them both being ground and brewed the same way and with the same quality of water and everything else. Is this normal?

my coffee doesn’t taste great. it kind of just tastes like water... like i really can’t taste much. so at first i thought it was the type of coffee i was using, so i bought really nice expensive fresh beans and had the same problem. what am i doing wrong?

what i do is i measure out 4 tablespoons of whole beans into my grinder, then grind it then pour all of it into the coffee machine. 

my beans are dark roast, and i’m grinding them to medium/fine i think. don’t know if i’m doing that wrong either.

Coffee,OXO Brew 8-cup experience (for smaller batches),"I recently got this brewer. I think it makes good tasting coffee without fuss, but it doesn't seem to work as well for brewing smaller amounts of coffee. My understanding and experience is that drip brewers tend to do better when brewing more coffee (without adjusting the coffee:water ratio). Since this brewer includes a small batch insert, I thought it might perform just as well when brewing less coffee.

The coffee maker works well when using the 4-8 cup setting, brewing at least 40 grams of coffee (in a typical 1:16 or 17 ratio). I've used the smaller single-serve insert plus the smaller filters to try brewing a smaller amount of coffee (25-35 g), but these tend to taste more watery. I've used up the included filters and have begun using the pricey Kalita wave filters (which seem similar to the included filters). (Note, for brewing 4-8 cups, walmart paper basket filters do just fine.) My grind is appropriate since I'm using pre-ground coffee for these experiments, which is way more uniform that what my current grinder can produce.

Any experience brewing a smaller amount of coffee? Is it necessary to use more coffee for a given amount of water?",1610045421

Coffee,Superautomatic machine for an office of ~30-50 people!,"Heyo!

My company is moving offices and that means we need to get our own coffee machine, which I’ve been pulled in to help out with picking.

I originaly wanted to get the Breville/Sage Oracle Touch, but I’ve been (ultimately, I think correctly) vetoed, saying that nobody is going to learn how to use portafilters and clean them properly.

So, into the realm of superautomatics we go. The problem is I know literally nothing about those — and am asking you for help :)

We’re probably looking at like \~60-ish drinks a day? It needs to be easy to use, and relatively easy to clean and maintain. It’d be perfect if it could steam milk and do cappuccinos/etc automagically to.

Sourcing good beans isn’t a problem, since we’re located in Berlin :)

We’re looking at probably \~2000 Euro budget here? I could maybe expand that a little bit, but not wildly so.

Or is the entire enterprise at this price range pointless, and I should let someone else pick a „meh” machine, and advocate for a separate, nice pourover setup for those who want to spend more than 30s brewing their coffee?

Coffee,"Too much caffeine, or not enough?","
I am not good at sleeping any more. I'm in my mid-40s. Used to sleep like a baby, but now, almost every night, I fall asleep quickly, but struggle to stay asleep through the night. I often have several hours where I am restless, and occasionally cannot sleep at all after, say 4 am.

As I result, I had been drinking a bit less coffee. I generally do pourovers at 18g, one in the morning and one in the early afternoon. I had been cutting back on the amount in my afternoon cup, hoping that in doing so, I would lessen the amount of caffeine in my system, and therefore get through the night more easily. Ive gotten down to 13g, but the impact on my sleep has not been significant.

Recently, I heard (maybe not for the first time) that the good feeling of drinking coffee in the morning is not from the stimulation of caffeine, but from relief from caffeine withdrawal symptoms. I have heard for years that caffeine doesn't actually ""wake you up"" but that it blocks a receptor for the hormone that makes us sleepy, so this makes a bit of sense.

So my experiment for today is to go back to drinking more in the afternoon. Maybe I can hit an amount where my withdrawal hits at 7, when I'm supposed to wake up???

Does anyone have experience with this? Am I crazy (its the sleep deprivation!)?",1610040365
Coffee,"Got a Timemore C2 manual grinder today. I am a complete newbie at coffee, I need some help regarding grind settings","I just started getting into coffee a few months ago, when a friend gave me a French press as a gift. I have since purchased an Aeropress but generally stuck to preground coffee until now, when I got a Timemore C2. It was delivered today. My beans came yesterday.

As I understand it, the 0 point for measuring grind settings is where the dial stops while turning it towards 'fine'. I did some research and decided to set the grind to 20 for my aeropress. While the cup I brewed was heavenly, and I definitely understand why one should go for freshly ground over pre ground, the grind seemed a little coarser than the preground stuff I am used to. (All the coffee vendors here let you pick the grind type when you order, and they are classified 'French press', 'aeropress' etc instead of numbers. You pick the grind type according to the equipment you have.)

Am I doing this right? Is the 0 point really how I described it? Is the grind setting I've used today actually optimal for Aeropress? If I'm understanding this correctly, the finest setting should be 0.",1610039699

Coffee,Cleaning grinder more important than I thought,"So, I was lazy and figured since I use my grinder everyday that it wouldn't really get clogged or 'dirty'. But I decided, why not, so I took it apart (baratza virtuoso+) and didn't do anything drastic, just used the included cleaning brush and wiped out the burrs, etc. Well, I solved the mystery of why my grind size has slowly been getting 'bigger.' Over time, I've noticed that I have been slowly moving the indicator to the right and was slightly perplexed why I've been having to do this when I recall getting good coffee at a 'smaller' grind without overextracting. Well, it seems that it was slowly clogging and causing the grind size to get smaller all on its own and I was just covering up the symptom. My first cup after grinding had much larger particles which I didn't notice til I was done brewing and looking at the coffee bed. It also brewed much faster so I ended up with a fairly under extracted cup, *but* I feel I learned something and helped make past experiences make more sense.

tea,Anyone have a favorite “Ruby Oolong”?,"So a Christmas gift from my son-in-law was a few samples from a small full-retail shop near their home. One of the selections was a ‘Ruby Oolong’, in this case a tightly-rolled aged oolong - tiny little orbs of dark appearance.
Quite a pleasant surprise band I’m sure I didn’t handle the first steep properly. The moniker is a style designation and seems to get stickered on batches from several different processors. I’m suspicious that their batch may have been sourced from Rishi in bulk as Rishi does such deals with some qualified sellers. https://www.rishi-tea.com/product/ruby-oolong-organic-oolong-tea/oolong-tea

So how do I properly handle this? The leaves didn’t fully unfurl till the 4th steep. The flavor is really good and reminds me of one of YS’s better offerings the “Red Ai Lo” here https://yunnansourcing.com/products/high-mountain-red-ai-lao-mountain-black-tea though the Ruby brews a more pale cup similar to many White teas.

on my first brew i did a flash steeping at around 180 degrees fahrenheit to be on the safe side, and i was suprised to find that the brew was sweet. it was a bit underwhelming though. it tasted more like a little sugar water and black coffee than anything. but the next infusion was very different.

i did my second infusion as a flash steep at a full boil. after i tried it i can finally say im a coffee fan. it had the nice body and scent of coffee with that sweetness staying around and even tasted lemony somehow at the end.

I got a nice bamboo tea tray as a christmas gift and I've been over the moon about it, but I'm still not quite sure how to go about taking care of it. It is the kind where you have a plastic box inside where the water goes. 

Some people say the tray should be washed and dried after each use, but since so far I've been using it several times a day it feels a bit funny to wash and dry it after every use. Is it enough if I do this at the end of the day when I know I won't be using it anymore that day? 

I got the tray two or three weeks ago and I think some parts have maybe already turned a bit darker because of the tannins of the tea (I assume). Is this a sign I haven't taken good enough care of the tray or is it something that happens over time no matter what you do? Also, some people say you should oil the tray. Is this necessary, and if so, how often should I oil it and what kind of oil would you recommend? Is there anything else to know about maintenance of the tray?

I'm using light roast beans that are not terribly oily. The only thing I can think that I'm doing that might be contributing to the problem is not keeping my beans in the hopper. I store them in an air tight can and only put the measured out beans into the hopper when grinding, and I'm wondering if the lack of the weight of the other beans is somehow the problem?

Is the $100 more for Kinu Phoenix worth it, let alone the $200 for Simplicity? Is there someone out there that had a 1Zpresso JX Pro and switched to a Kinu?

Other info: I currently have a Baratza Encore for brewing with mostly V60/Origami. I’ll probably switch between grinding for espresso and pourover, which is why I shortlisted Kinu rather than Comandante. Also the Kinu M47 Classic (SGD 525) is way out of my budget.",1610034364

Coffee,Help with a home brew upgrade,"Tl;dr - wanting to upgrade my morning coffee balancing taste with convenience. Considering grind a brew, machine from SCA website, or nespresso.

Long form: I've been using a basic auto drip coffee maker for years. I buy pre ground coffee from the grocery store, and I prep things the night before so coffee is ready to go in the morning. Lately though I've been getting tired of the taste I've grown accustomed to, and looking to improve my cup.

From what I've read, one of the best ways to do this is by fresh grinding beans, especially freshly roasted ones. Problem is I don't want to grind first thing in the AM, and it sounds like grinding night before is a waste.

I've had a keurig in the past, but the waste got to me. 

I've tried a nespresso and really liked the coffee, but the price for the pods gives me pause, as does the lack of coffee options. Also, the single serves bother me than you have to purchase specific coffee to get specific volumes. For keurig that means more water for the sw amount of coffee, for nespresso that means buying the right pod that will even let you do it.

I want better tasting coffee, but I don't want to add much time to my morning routine.

Where that leads me is three options:
1) grind and brew machine, maybe like: https://www.cuisinart.com/shopping/appliances/coffee_makers/dgb-850/
2) a machine from the SCA website, where I would hope it brews better regardless of beans... https://sca.coffee/certified-home-brewer

Coffee,Does stale coffee 'absorb' less water?,"So quick background. I bought two bags of coffee (beans) back in september to use in my moka-pot that I hadn't used in a while. I experimented a bit, but I couldn't get any drinkable coffee out of it. No matter the grind size or technique I used, it always tasted horrible. So I just stopped drinking coffee altogether.

Flash-forward a few months and I get a V60 set for Christmas. Of course I start by using the (3-4 month) old coffee first, can't be wasteful. I practice my technique a bit, but somehow blooming never worked well. Every time I poured water on the coffee grounds, it just ran straight trough. I adjusted the grind size a bit finer, and finally it *just barely* absorbed enough water to bloom for 20 seconds or so.

This week I finally got through my old bags and bought a new bag of beans. And holy shit, now suddenly blooming is so easy. Just pouring like 30-40g of water on 15g of coffee is plenty, whereas with my old beans I could barely make it with 60g of water.

Anyone else had this experience where old beans absorbed way less water than fresh beans? It seems so weird but the difference is just staggering.",1610010232

Coffee,Changing Burrs on a Domestic Grinder,"Hi all,

I'm wondering if anyone has ever changed the burr set on their home coffee grinder? Did you find it difficult and to what extent did it improve your brewing?

I purchased a Precision GS1 Pour Over grinder last year which uses ghost burrs.  I've found over the course of its use that 1. It's grind size on the grinders' optimal range is far larger than what I want for my pour over coffee, and 2. I'm using near the uppermost steps where it's creating at massive amount of fines.

Do you think swapping out the burr set would improve these two issues?
Is it worth it or should I just save up some more money and replace it with a more expensive grinder?",1610004270

Coffee,I have less than 24 hours to prepare to make 20 cups of coffee. See parameters in text.,"Title.

So I have a new job and people in the office were very interested with the short bio about me and my coffee that I wrote for myself in the company website. They wanted to have a taste and so I took up the challenge to make coffee just this one time, or should I probably postpone it until the next working day so I could prepare and secure more gear (just filters and more coffee really)?

I own a:

* Comandante C40

* V60 01 with barely enough filters

* Kalita Wave 155 and 185 but no filters

* A Fellow Stagg EKG and a Hario Buono 1L

* Likely not enough coffee (I ain't sharing my Geshas, sorry)
* Hario 450ml decanter (likely 50ml less than the planned 500ml per brew, but still actually fits)

My plan of attack is as follows given what I have now:

* Pour-over
* 200ml/12.5g (1:16) serves for each person
* with the V60 01, brew 3 cups every 5 minutes (is it possible?)
* Coarser grind, enough to keep the entire brewing process drip within 02:30
* 100c temp just to be sure
* No time to use fancy water, just tap
* 30 minutes to brew everything?

What can I do to make the entire duration less miserable and more efficient?",1609984841

Coffee,Question about sub 10g brews,"Hello all, 

I have been surfing around the subreddit for a while now and started diving into making more coffee at home. 

I have been curious to ask if anyone here have much experiences with sub 10g brews. 

As well curious if there a method that favors smaller brews? i.e. 7.5-8g for a (1/4 cup/125ml) of coffee? Does coffee brewing even scale down well that low? Would be interesting to hear thoughts on this. Or could it be that at under 10grams there is simply not enough heat in the water for the duration of the brew time for a proper extraction? 

As much as I love the smell and taste of coffee in the morning I am rather sensitive to caffeine. Regular serving sizes (1cup/250ml/8oz) 15-20g at 1:16 simply makes too much coffee for me to comfortably drink in a sitting. I have resorted to saving the remaining coffee for the following day, warming it up in the microwave with some milk and sugar. I hate to waste coffee. 

Currently I use an old French press. Frequently finding my brews to be sour (perhaps under extracted from such small volumes?). I purchased a 1spresso jx pro from rogue wave up here in Canada as a Christmas present to myself to get better grind consistency, perhaps I have not been able to dial in the settings. 

I am looking at the following as possible alternatives to my French press

* Kalita wave 155 in sandstone.
* Hario V60 01 Clear plastic 
* Hario Switch 

I am leaning to the Kalita 155 as reviews of its easy brew consistency is appealing especially since I am not the most coordinated in the morning. As well  I am concerned about the potential ability to brew in the V60 well consistently with only 125g of water to work with. 

Will definitely purchase a goose neck kettle to have steady pours. 

I'd love to hear your experiences. Cheers.",1609974224

I am trying to find my way back to the consistent cup of rich dark coffee I had savoringly enjoyed in days now passed.

I use a Presto 6-Cup electric percolator, which had always delivered a strong cup of coffee just as I like. I love my small all-stainless steel percolator and the last thing I would expect is that it would start coughing up the watered down, near-clear, sorry excuse for coffee that it is giving me now.

This all started when I purchased a burr grinder. I'm using the Cuisineart DBM-8. My goal was to get a stronger cup of coffee while reducing the occasional extreme bitterness from the percolator. I had been using pre-ground medium and dark roast coffee in my infancy and the coffee was always strong. Now with my burr-ground coffee, every brew is like a game of Russian Roulette with four chambers loaded.

Here are the facts:

1. The burr grinder is working. I photographed the results from grinds on every other marker from finest-coarsest. 
2. I have tried making coffee from very fine to very coarse and everywhere in-between, with no big change. When the coffee comes out good, it is better when using a finer setting, but the probability it comes out good is about the same.
3. I have used medium, medium-dark, and dark roasts, but the probability the coffee comes out good is about the same.
4. I always fill the coffee ground container to either the top or the near-top. For finer grinds I have attempted to pre-soak the grounds for 10-15 minutes to no effect.
5. The coffee ground container is throughly soaked through after every brew, even when results are watered down.
6. Using pre-ground coffee, I always filled the peculator to its 6-cups of water maximum with no problem. I have tried using 3, 4, and 5 cups of water without reducing the amount of coffee grounds, and this has had a small but negligible effect on the coffee. When the coffee does comes out good, it is however better. 

The only consistent success I have had is by brewing the coffee, pouring out the water-down coffee, and then running a second brew over the grinds again. This is wasteful, time-consuming, and surely must lead to sub-optimal flavor. Unfortunately, pre-soaking the grounds with warm water does not have the same effect. This leads me to believe that the only solution I have is to buy a brand new percolator with a manual timing mechanism, or a stove-top percolator. It does not make sense to me that  I would need to make such a drastic change simply by using freshly ground coffee, especially considering the grounds are still soaked-through post-brew. Educate me.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Percolated coffee coming out watered down when using freshly ground coffee, but pre-ground coffee comes out strong. Nothing wrong with the grinder. Already tried varying grind fineness/coarseness settings, water amount, and roasts type. Grounds are always soaked-through post-brew. Only solution has been to run the percolator a second time with fresh water, which feels to me like a bad solution. Is there something critical about freshly ground coffee that I'm missing?",1609959504

Coffee,Help repairing a broken Steam Wand for the Iberital IB7!,"Hiya folks,

I've got a 3 group Iberital IB7, with 2 steam wands. Recently however, the left hand steam wand dial started getting stuck occasionally, but now it's almost completely stuck. It can turn maybe 3/4 of a complete rotation, but not enough to start the steam, as that needs at least a full rotation, if not more. I popped the dial off, and underneath I could see the steam valve insert. The little snap washer was bent out of shape, which I believe is what caused the dial to jam. [Here is an example of the full insert,](https://www.espressounderground.co.uk/VALVE-INSERT-ORIGINAL-PN-IB2383-p/ib2383.htm) and the washer sits at the front of that [and looks like this, but brass.](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-51wyxax1je/images/stencil/original/products/97102/52576/703432_1__47367.1583861789.jpg?c=2) The technical diagrams are [available online](https://www.iberital.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/iberital-IB7.pdf), and on page 4, you can see exactly the part I'm trying to describe.

So, my first question is can I just replace the washer? I removed the washer, and then from comparison to the non-faulty wand, I bent it back into shape, but was unable to snap it back onto the valve insert. Would the insert need to be disassembled to pop the washer back into place? Secondly, since the replacement insert is only £14, I might just go for that, but if I did would it just be as simple as unscrewing the old valve and screwing the new one on? [A youtube tutorial I found suggests that to be the case,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-u6f_NdgKE) but I wanted to check regardless. Would I need to turn off the machine and wait for it to cool down? Lastly, because I don't want to throw £50 away for the official tool, does anyone know what size socket I would need to remove the insert? I have an embarrassingly incomplete socket set at home, so might need to buy the right size separately.

Hopefully I've not just written a bunch of nonsense, I know absolutely nothing about machine servicing, so for all I know I'm completely on the wrong track!",1609956034
Coffee,Gaggia Classic Pro Steamer Defective?,"I just bought a brand new Gaggia Classic Pro (RI9380/46), and I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if the steamer is defective.

I've seen that there is a trick to start steaming before the indicator light goes on, but that doesn't make much of a difference when I've tried it.


In order to get any semblance of pressure, I need to brew the espresso first. If I turn on the machine and let it warm up, and then try to steam first, I'll only get the odd bubble or two and then it sputters out. I get a steady stream of water if I turn on the brewing and steam switch though.

Today however I thought, why not leave the bloom in and see how it goes. To my surprise I think it taste better. A more robust expression of the different notes in the coffee. It does leave a slight bitterness in the coffee that wasn't there before but I am fine with that.

Amazon sells a single solenoid.  I'm not sure if I should buy two of them and just clean the metal part that they attach to really well.  Or, should I attempt to clean the original component?  

Any advice?  It would be much appreciated.",1609949624
Coffee,Melitta tasting less of coffee and more of water?,"We've had our Melitta Caffeo Passione machine for almost a year and using it about 3 times a week

As of the past few weeks the coffee it makes is starting to taste less and less of coffee and more of water instead? It's no longer giving that rich taste of coffee in a cup anymore and instead you immediately notice how weak the taste is (you can tell it's too much water in the cup compared to the coffee)

We haven't changed anything in the settings and the machine seems to grind the correct amount of beans for a cup


Anyone else had a similar thing? What can the issue be?

We cleaned the coffee system yesterday assuming that might be the issue but no change. We also maintain the machine routinely per the instructions it gives.

Anyone have any idea what can cause weak/poor taste in the coffee like this?",1609949217
Coffee,Just made my first pour over using pre-grounds and eyeballing water. Would love your thoughts/considerations!,"A 'NO-FRILLS' COFFEE JOURNEY:

I don't have anything to compare it to, but I have to say it wasn't a bad cup of coffee. It tasted better than most gas station/fast food cups that I have tried (e.g. not burnt tasting, but maybe a little bit sour).

What I used:

1. 2 tbsp of preground coffee from the grocery store
2. \#4 filter that I had from an old coffee machine
3. gooseneck kettle and 3-hole dripper
4. Filled my mug (8-10 oz) with brita water and dumped it into a kettle as an 'eyeball' measurement
5. 200 degree water

I don't have all the equipment yet, and really do not plan on buying a burr grinder, whole beans, scale, pour over filters, etc. until I am sure I would like to use this method in the future. If you ask me, all the basic equipment you ""need"" is a pretty expensive upfront cost for something you don't know if you will even like or want to do again.

My understanding is that that would probably be caused by an inconsistent grind size, and a little further examination of the grounds produced by my Encore does show a little inconsistency in grind size, so is  the Baratza Encore not suited for finer grinds like moka pot or is this like a calibration issue that I can fix?

tea,I finally fixed my tea steeping issues,"My tea were way too light for weeks, and i tried many things. More leaves, less leaves, lid on, lid off, and tried different water temps and amounts too.

Now i found the culprit. Its the cold indoor temperature. The fix is very simple, hit the lid on immediately after pouring the hot water into the mug. I used to wait for maybe a minute, put close the leaf bag, put away water thermometer, and do couple of other things, and then put the lid on. Cleaning up the table takes me maybe 1 min or little bit more, but apparently its enough for my brewing glass to cool down too much. Now, i clean after steeping for sure.

https://cdn.conranshop.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/8a394d7302b6f57bd505c0072f6cff11/9/6/960946_3_b9ca.jpg

Thats the type of glass i use, but mine is 510ml, which i find better becauae that strainer goes all the down, so making smaller cups is possible, while being able to brew big amounts.

Thats Finnish winter indoor temps, combined with thin glass, and without a lid its impossible to make good cups. That water temp cools like 3c o 4c by just pouring, and in that extra 1 min of waiting, it keeps dropping fast, overall by maybe 8c or more.

I tend to do long steep with colder temps, and no second steeps. For Kabusecha, which recommends me 70c temps, i do 65c or so, for 4 min. Previously my temps were likely around low 50's, so no wonder the taste wasnt there. Compensating with something like 80c water, and lidless steep, worked even worse. Hot water killed the subtle taste notes, and then the water cooled like mofo, and was too cold to get any flavors.

At least now i know, why my tea didnt become bitter no matter what, but also was too weak and thin.",1609090819

For Christmas, my dad and his fiancé gave me a BEAUTIFUL gaiwan set from Yunnan sourcing. Unfortunately, I live in a small apartment without much room for extra dishes.

I’m working my way through a big bag of rose-flavored small-leaf black (better suited for Western brewing), so I probably won’t use them for a few weeks until I can finish what I have.

How do you guys most effectively store your gaiwans so they don’t break? Is my “box and tissue paper” method good enough in the meantime?

A few days ago I stopped by a Starbucks and ordered a matcha latte. I know, it's nowhere near close to the real thing, but that taste... it tasted like fish and cabbage. I had this happen with a Japanese Sencha that I made early on in my tea journey, and oh my God. That fishy and cabbage taste makes me gag so bad, so now I'm wondering if that's maybe somewhat close to what matcha tastes like? I cannot believe this kind of taste could possibly come from a few leaves, and I know for a fact it wasn't a spoiled beverage from Starbucks because I managed to recreate that taste when I made Japanese Sencha for the first time. I know now how to make it, and it's hard to get it right, but when I do it tastes great.

The only problem are the prices - all of their teaware is very expensive. It seems to me it's so expensive, because they are faithful replicas of ancient porcelain from China.

Coffee,Took me years to break out of my regular coffee habits. Makes a world of difference once you change things.,"For 15 years I had coffee almost everyday. I was kinda strict about my ratio, using the standard 10g coffee grounds per 6oz water. I also started every day with coffee, as soon I was woke up and had breakfast. 

Occasionally I had mild stomach aches, but most of the time I felt jittery. But I couldn't give up coffee entirely, so I decided to give up on my old habits. I delayed my morning coffee to 1-2h after I wake up, sometimes even longer, into lunch hours, and instead, for breakfast I had a small cup of black tea. 

I usually had a 12oz cup so that meant \~20g of coffee. I started to experiment, using 10g coffee with 12oz water. It was definitely a weaker coffee, but it didn't make as jittery as before. I found a good middle ground with 10g coffee 8 oz water.  And this is what I'm sticking with, at least for now. 

I even noticed I can taste the coffee more. Using this ratio also means a pack of coffee will last me twice as long now. 

Hopefully I've inspired you to look at your coffee routine and see if you can change anything. Don't get stuck into the same old cup of coffee just because you're used to it, especially if you're concerned about your health.",1609934662

Coffee,Scientific comparison of Aeropress and Stovetop coffee,"So I have been using a stove top with pre-ground coffee for a couple of months. I recently decided to upgrade my set-up and bought a hand grinder (which came with an Aeropress), some fine scales and some whole coffee beans. 

My 2-cup stovetop takes about 11-12g of coffee at a medium-fine grind and produced a suitable amount for 1.5-2 people’s cups. The Aeropress recipes all seem to ask for much more coffee per cup. Has anyone else found that?

I thought I’d try and be a bit more scientific and brew the same amounts of coffee and water in a stovetop AND Aeropress then try the results. NOTE: I’m fairly new to Aeropress so please be kind about my technique!

First up - Stovetop.
The filter took 12g of coffee. Levelled off without any tamping. Freshly boiled water filled to below pressure valve. Heated until spouts started gurgling then immediately plunged into cold water to stop any more extraction. This yielded about 67g of coffee fluid.

Next - Aeropress.
Using 12g of coffee in an inverted method. I first poured 67g off-boil water over 10s. Stirred the mixture for 15s. Then waited another 25s before pressing as hard and fast as possible until hissing stopped.

The results.
The stovetop coffee was notably stronger and thicker but not bitter - trust me I have had plenty of bitter stovetop coffee! The Aeropress tasted weaker but was smooth. Overall it seems like the stovetop provides the thicker coffee I like. However it is perhaps easier to overextract than an Aeropress?

How about you, what are your experiences of using both of them?

NOTE: This isn’t a thread about which is better or worse. I am just interested to hear people’s experiences of how they differ in taste and consistency.",1609920351

It arrived around 3 weeks ago and since then all of my pour over coffee at the office has been made using the gooseneck kettle.

I had a previously commented on a few thread that I really didn't see how a gooseneck kettle could be much of an improvement over carefully pouring from a traditional short spout kettle.  Well, I think I may have been wrong.  While I have not performed a blind A/B comparison, so it could be in my mind, it does seem that my cups are more consistent and more dialed in.  I have not gotten more than one or two cups that were overly sour since I started using the gooseneck.  The grinder, grind setting, filters, water source, and everything else are unchanged.  I am pleasantly surprised and quite happy to admit that I may have been wrong.

On a different note, I was given some shade grown coffee by my normal shop to replace a bag that of my regular beans that was found to be not fully sealed.  Man this shade grown stuff is nice.

Coffee,How does a coarse grind taste good with V60?,"Hey everyone,   
So I got a V60 for christmas and have been going wild with experimentation. I've mostly been following James Hoffmann's recipe but have also tried Scott Rao's and the 4:6 method. I recently tried some beans from a friend where the head roaster recommended a coarse grind, 1:13 ratio, aiming for a brew time of 2 minutes. I thought, this must be a mistake, because every recipe I've found calls for medium-fine grind setting. I figured, the roaster must know these beans better than anyone else, so let's try it out. To my surprise, it was amazing. I was blown away by the brightness from the cup yet it tasted balanced and not overly acidic. I then for kicks brewed the beans with the James Hoffmann method and ratio and it tasted awful. I feel like this roasters method breaks everything I've learned about V60's so far. Is it the low ratio that makes the coarse grind work? What science behind this am I not getting?",1609911464

It is currently on week 3 after roast and I am having trouble dialing it in. I am using the newer JX Pro (Grey Dot) at a 33 setting - 3 rotations and 3 numbers and a Hario Switch. My grinder’s zero is at 2, so technically I am at 3 rotations and 1 number in reality. I am following the Hoffmann recipe of 15g to 250g boiling water, 2 min steep, stir, 15 sec pause after stirring and drawdown. I have the untabbed Hario filters and am getting a slightly less than one minute drawdown. The aroma of the coffee is straight up raspberry, but the cup tastes rather one dimensional.

Coffee,Good coffee from a vintage siphon pot,"Maybe two or three years ago after returning from Japan, I decided I wanted to try replicating the siphon coffee that we were served for our first breakfast. I some research and found out that they used to be very common in the US before auto-percolators took off in the 1960s. I then bought a Nicro Model 500 off Craigslist with the metal filter, figuring it would be less prone to breakage than glass and easier to clean than a cloth filter.

The problem is, I could never make good coffee. The water wouldn't heat up to the suggested 205 degrees and it would clog instead of draining. 

Then, this past week, I tried it again and it made excellent coffee. It was complex, deep, clean, and even warmer at first sip than a pour-over. I used:

* a light generic breakfast roast
* a 17.5:1 ratio
* a grind size similar to pre-ground drip coffee
* 900g of water, enough for three mugs of coffee
* no temperature measurement, only turning down stove and waiting for water to stop bubbling in the upper chamber
* coffee steeping for around a minute, then turned off gas and let coffee drain

Full brew time was somewhere from 5-7 minutes. 

I started thinking how I might have lucked into such a good cup and I realized that a big batch, high ratio, drip grind generic coffee, and no temp control is probably how the device was meant to be used in a 1950s kitchen or diner, where there wouldn't have been fancy grinders, temp probes, or even time to fuss over the coffee like I would with a manual pour-over.

Coffee,Tricks to latte art with french press frother?,"I bought a bodum milk frother, basically a slightly different french press, as an upgrade for my frother wand. Although I'm getting closer to the silky white finish like steamed milk, it still has too much micro bubbles.

I can hear the small bubbles pop if I put the cup to my ear. When I pour the milk to my moka coffee, the foam just floats right on top instead of mixing.

On youtube I've seen some pretty decent latte art with just a french press. Is there a technique to this? Am I doing this wrong?

Here's what I do:
1. Microwave milk in press to 65C
2.  3 big pumps with the press pulling out of the surface of milk
3. Continuous quick presses while keeping the press within the liquid. Periodic swirls
4. A minute of this then take the top off, swirl out bubbles
5. Pour into milk frothing jug",1609888628

Coffee,"Don't Give Up Experimenting &amp; ""Beating A Dead Horse""","For the last several weeks my coffee has been really off and consistently bad to the point where I've even questioned if I still like coffee. I am quite new yet so I figured it was my doing and I could fix it with some changes, especially since my coffee was good in the past. No matter what I did it was just awful, my brews ranged from coffee tea to straight up battery acid. From changing recipes, beans, and even brew style. Then I recently picked up some light roast beans from a local roaster. It has totally turned it around again, perfect coffee everytime the last few days. To think I almost wanted to quit brewing. 

The point in this post is for anyone who isn't having great results with their coffee right now, especially if you're new: Don't quit! Keep trying new things, whether it's trying different roasts, trying new brew methods, or upgrading your coffee quality. Eventually you'll hit gold and dial in whatever you're struggling with so you can get back to loving coffee.

Coffee,Do you wash your coffee pot/carafe with soap and water?,"I was at my mom's for the holidays and as I was about to wash the coffee pot with soap and water, as one does, she exclaimed in horror ""No! Never wash it with soap, just rinse it with hot water!"". When I asked her why, she couldn't give me a reason other than that's what she was always told.  So I gave her a suspicious side-eye, but begrudgingly went along with it and drank coffee out of a pot with brown stains all around the insides of it, because she's at the age where you can't tell her what she's always known is wrong.  

It's not the first time I've had someone tell me they don't use soap on their coffee pots... back when I was too young too know better than to drink the office coffee, a co-worker also told me they don't use soap because it leaves residue that affects the flavor of the coffee.  I was suspicious then as well, since if he believed hot water was hot enough to get rid of the residual coffee oils (which it's not) why wouldn't it also be able to get rid of the soap residue?  He also told me his theory applied to wine glasses as well and I almost fainted.  

I feel like this is a myth that needs to die.  Coffee flavors come from the oil in the beans right? Oil exposed to air goes rancid over time.  Oil and water don't mix, so hot water is not enough to completely get rid of residual coffee oils (otherwise we wouldn't need soap to clean greasy pans!).  Rancid oil residues in your fresh pot of coffee will make it taste not as good as it should, thus the logical conclusion would be that if you really don't want the flavor of your coffee being affected by any foreign substances, you need to wash you coffee pots (and filter baskets) with soap and water.

With that said, I do agree that some brands of dish soap (like Palmolive and Dawn, and pretty much any dishwasher detergent) don't rinse clean unless you rinse them very very well, which I didn't realize until I started wondering why my glass of water always had a thin layer of bubbles at the top (hint, they weren't air bubbles).  But I've found that using a soap made with more ""natural"" ingredients (like Mrs Meyers or Trader Joes) rinses away very quickly and leaves no discernible residue.

I think I may have just answered my own question, but still wondering what others' thoughts are on soap in your coffee pot.  I get taking the hot water rinsing shortcut a few days in a row, and I definitely have been guilty of it, but I don't understand being adamant about NEVER using soap for fear it's going to run your coffee.",1609882197

Coffee,Quality small Auto Drip?,"I come hat in hand to ask a question that I know has been asked many times before (I’ve searched, I promise!) but with perhaps a little more detail.

I am looking for recommendations for a “single cup” auto drip brewer to replace my trusty, albeit lackluster Hamilton Beach Scoop. “Single cup” is in quotes because many in that category are just a touch too small.

My concerns and needs are these:

1) I am the only coffee drinker in the house and generally have one 14-16 ounce coffee each morning. Rarely a second. Also, the battle for counter space is real in my house. It needs to be small.

2) I hate cleanup. Fewer parts is better. Brewing directly into the mug is best! I was eyeballing the Bonavita, but the basket-on-carafe design means using and cleaning the carafe every time. No thanks.

3) This will not replace my Aeropress, French press, etc. I will spend the time when I have it, but most days I need the coffee to take care of itself while I spend time feeding my two preschool-aged kids.

4) I have begun roasting my own as a hobby, but I rarely have time for cupping. Having an auto drip that lets me taste my coffee the best it can be in my daily cup is very helpful.

Thanks to anyone who has taken the time to read, and to anyone who might have recommendations!",1609880552
Coffee,Aeropress v Stovetop,"So I have been using a stove top with pre-ground coffee for a couple of months. I recently decided to upgrade my set-up and bought a hand grinder (which came with an Aeropress), some fine scales and some whole coffee beans. 

My 2-cup stovetop takes about 11-12g of coffee at a medium-fine grind and produced a suitable amount for 1.5-2 people’s cups. The Aeropress recipes all seem to ask for much more coffee per cup. Has anyone else found that?

I thought I’d try and be a bit more scientific and brew the same amounts of coffee and water in a stovetop AND Aeropress then try the results. NOTE: I’m fairly new to Aeropress so please be kind about my technique!

First up - Stovetop.
The filter took 12g of coffee. Levelled off without any tamping. Freshly boiled water filled to below pressure valve. Heated until spouts started gurgling then immediately plunged into cold water to stop any more extraction. This yielded about 67g of coffee fluid.

Next - Aeropress.
Using 12g of coffee in an inverted method. I first poured 67g off-boil water over 10s. Stirred the mixture for 15s. Then waited another 25s before pressing as hard and fast as possible until hissing stopped.

The results.
The stovetop coffee was notably stronger and thicker but not bitter - trust me I have had plenty of bitter stovetop coffee! The Aeropress tasted weaker but was smooth. Overall it seems like the stovetop provides the thicker coffee I like. However it is perhaps easier to overextract than an Aeropress?

How about you, what are your experiences of using both of them?

NOTE: This isn’t a thread about which is better or worse. I am just interested to hear people’s experiences of how they differ in taste and consistency.",1609880337
Coffee,Best method to make Coffee,"I am fairly new to drinking coffee. Part of the issue I'm currently having is that my partner likes their coffee darker than I do, but I also think I don't like the taste a basic coffeepot gives you.

It was amazing! The concern I have with this method is that a)I am clumsy and b)I have cat's and a child. I think if I got this, it would break very quickly. 

I guess my overall question is, what would give a similar depth of flavor, would be easy to use and clean, and less likely to break? I was thinking French Press perhaps, but I'm not sure because I'm so new to making coffee

Coffee,Next step in coffee brewing - Choosing a new hand grinder,"Hey hey hey!

I'm going through what I consider the first stage of frustration for whoever gets closer to coffee brewing at home: not having a reliable coffee grinder. Having a Hario Slim is turning to be highly frustrating due to its wobbling mechanics and inconsistent (mostly dusty) grind.

It has been a nice tool to start learning the basics of adjusting the grind to the brewing type, it has been a nice companion so far, but I feel that I have to part ways with it.

When considering the candidates, two were the main factors in play: the grinder should be somewhat portable (considering that I'm traveling a lot) and should be oriented for filter coffee.

Here is the end result of my selection (Ordered by most expensive to least expensive):

* Comandante C40 MK3 Nitro Blade
* Kinu M47 Phoenix (possibly with pour-over blades)
* 1Zpresso JX-Pro

I'm asking you because the amount of details which can be found online are somewhat scary, extensive and also obscure. Do you currently own one of these grinders? Would you recommend one of these in particular? Do you feel that some other grinder should be my list?",1609879588

Coffee,How to scale brew time,"When you scale (up or down) coffee amounts, do you also scale times? I've tried both scaling and not scaling it and it feels like it doesn't work well either way, the coffee doesn't taste as good as the original recipe.

Coffee,Picking up/squeezing v60 filter??,"Just a quick post, looking for other people's opinions. So today I went into our local Cafe and decided to try a new pour over Guatemala roast. I was able to see what their barista was doing, and everything seemed normal until the end. After pouring she waited until the cone drained maybe half way, then pinched the top together and kind of moved the filter in a circle around the cone. In my experience with pour over you simply wait for your filter to drain and throw it away. The way I see it is you're applying pressure, AND squeezing those last few drops from the grounds, which just sounds like a recipe for bitter over extracted coffee. It's not like it was bad or anything, but I like getting the max potential out of my beans. What do y'all think? Ever apply pressure at the end of your brew? Why? Why not? How did it taste?

I get a pretty weak cup of coffee.  It's not bad but it is not strong, nor flavorful. 
I actually think a Peets coffee that they brew at the Peets coffee shop, while having a lot of flavor is too strong for me, so I don't mind that Gaggia output is weaker, but using Peets beans purchased at a grocery gives a much much weaker cup from the machine.

I had a few hiccups with stopping the drip, and the grinds becoming saturated and not dripping through. That was solved by my next batch with a more coarse grind. Currently just finished my first bag of Stumptown coffee - it was exactly the same taste that I was getting from the local shop so I am pleasantly surprised I got that right.

My next batch I am going to use pH balanced water and try to make sure I use the coldest water possible. Any suggestions on how to keep the water cold, I do add ice but that just increases the water in the tank and more water out. I was thinking of doing an ice bath around the beaker that holds the grounds, custom Tupperware setup and keep adding ice to that instead of the water tank itself.

Also this is my first time brewing coffee (minus the pre-ground coffee at the office).

tea,Few questions regarding tea infusion,"So I have just recently gotten into the art of true tea making, most my life I had never had much outside of a tea bag so finding out that tea could be so rich and complex was exciting for me. I purchased some loose Japanese sencha from harney and sons and have been experimenting with how to make the perfect cup because all mine have been tasting very very weak even if I’m using significantly more than the recommended tea:water ratio. I have read most of the FAQ but still very very new to this.

So I have a few questions to sure I am doing everything I can to make my tea as well as possible, since I have a whole lot of other new exciting flavors coming soon. I have a big electric tea kettle with multiple temperatures and an infuser that is inserted into it but is removable. I have noticed here that lots of people tend to prefer more traditional brewing methods, but I assume nothing is wrong with this as well. My first question is when should the infuser be inserted into the warming kettle? Does it matter if I wait until the kettle is heated and then inserting it or can I begin with the infuser in while heating. I also assumed I should remove it after 3 minutes, but someone told me that I could just leave my infuser in there and that that there’s no reason to remove it after time as you would a tea bag but that makes no sense to me.

I’m also wondering if anyone has any tips to achieving more flavor from the tea. I am using the recommended 175 degrees farenheight brewing temperature for the sencha, but green tea I’ve had at nice restaurants is so much more flavorful and I feel like that shouldn’t be the case. Is this just sencha specifically that does not carry a strong taste? I appreciate any advice, I also have some dragon well and oolong teas coming soon, which I’m very excited for!",1608921975

tea,[HELP PLEASE] Matcha only tastes amazing in ice cream.,"Matcha has always been one of my favorite ice cream flavors. As in skid the ice cream with the side of a spoon enough to barely coat the brim and savor every last bite good. Matcha tea on the other hand is an entirely different story. 

I had recently acquired ceremonial grade matcha and was excited to try it. A pleasantly sweet aroma echoed into the air as the tin was opened. I followed tutorials online to make sure it was prepared correctly. (water temperature, whisking motions, sifting the powder etc.) A fluorescent green foamy drink sat in front of me and I was eager to try it.  Yet I ended up being disappointed on how the taste came out. It was just bitter water. A different kind of bitter from premium/culinary grade matcha but it wasn't as satisfying as I would like. The experience reminded of coffee(another flavour that only tastes good in ice cream). Just a different iteration of bitter water. I don't think it was the milk or sugar that makes matcha in ice cream delicious as trying matcha tea with those doesn't yield favourable results.

So I'm currently wondering: Is the temperature of ice cream the deciding factor that allows me to enjoy matcha? Can I not enjoy matcha unless it's cold enough to omit the unpleasant flavors? And how exactly does temperature impact the taste of matcha?

The change in variance of flavour from tradiational matcha to matcha ice cream has left me feeling conflicted. Does this make me a ""fake fan"" of matcha as I don't like it served in its traditional form?

Jin Jun Mei

9/10 - 12 infusions

This is the real thing. Rose water, chocolate, lightly fruity, and a hint of honeysuckle. early infusions are marked by chocolate with infusions 5-9 being distinctly woody. the later infusions become sweeter with the honeysuckle shining through. I stopped at 12 infusions but it could probably go 2 more. this tea also surprisingly mellow for Jin Jun Mei, I felt very relaxed much like being in a very soft beanbag? I think that is how I would describe the feel of the tea. very luxurious beanbag while snacking on chocolates.

&amp;#x200B;

Fei Zi Xiao(Smile of Princess)

8.5/10 - 12 infusions

Reminds me of glacier melt I had in the Canadian Rockies. Crisp, rocky, and cooling(not like dancong cooling though). It has a very incorporated water taste which gives it a very unique character and permeates all of the steeps while different aspects of litchi come and go. This is a lot like I would guess an unsmoked lapsang souchong would taste if I had only had the smoked version. litchi is the primary flavor of the tea but it changes from more of an aroma to a more tangible taste the more you dig into the tea. I would like to note that this tea is not very sweet at the start but the aftertaste does have a distinct sweetness.

&amp;#x200B;

Bense Smoked Lapsang Souchong

9.5/10 - 15 infusions

everything you want from a Lapsang Souchong and more. Classic smokey flavor with dried longans with added hot-chocolate; I would have expected to like this combination at a glance but it works so well. Perfect for snow-days and keeps you feeling warm for hours with a subtle lingering sweetness. I wish I could say more but smoked Lapsang Souchong tends to be a two note tea and this one has a wonderful 3rd note that puts it above the norm. I ended up trying brews 15-18 and they still had flavor but were lacking enough that I would say 15 infusions is a good place to stop judging the tea.

&amp;#x200B;

Aged Fir Narcissus

7.5/10 - 10 infusions

When I opened the sample and smelled it, I said ""that's definitely Jin Jun Mei."" This tea shares a lot of those characteristics such as the long sweet aftertaste and chocolate and floral notes but is distinctly different. It is a lot earthier overall while Jin Jun Mei is more light and floral. There is a nice cinnamon note in the first couple infusions and a marzipan note later on. I also picked up a consistent lemon flavor throughout the tea but it was really hard for me to place until I smelled the leaves once I was done with all infusions, because there is no sour or acidic flavor to this tea the lemon was surprising. Overall a solid tea but it lacked solidity in the flavor notes that the other teas possessed. For example, while I could definitely taste marzipan on brews 7-9 it never really held together between sips and left me wanting more but never delivering. Very unique flavors and definitely a tea worth trying if you are interesting in getting into Jin Jun Mei but prefer earthier flavors over the lighter floral ones that the traditional Jin Jun Mei offers.

&amp;#x200B;

Shui Di Xiang

7.5/10 - 12 infusions

This tea was described as ""unique water fragrance"" but I would classify it more as litchi, blackberry, huckleberry. This tea is solidly fruity, a lot of teas are described as such while having light notes of fruit but this one the fruit is out and on display. The background notes are chocolatey and earthy with a small amount of burnt caramel that comes out more in later infusions. these combination of background notes bring a smooth body to the tea while the fruity and tart notes up front keep your mouth watery; a very interesting combination that I enjoyed. unfortunately the tea did not offer much in terms of lasting flavors as they dissipated within a few minutes of drinking. side note: this is the first tea out of the 5 that had a twig in it, the rest have been purely leaf and/or bud. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts so far: fantastic teas. I have not sampled a place before that has had this level of consistency in teas. I will definitely be picking up some of the Bense Smoked Lapsang Souchong as this tea really stood out. I got a couple more samples of Jin Jun Mei from other sources coming in so I will wait to try those. Only real downside to this place that I have seen in the first half is that they only offer black teas so its not a place I can solely get my teas from.",1608857049

Coffee,moka pot w/ electric coil range,"Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster here

I use my Moka pot on an electric coil range (not induction) and wanted to describe my method that is giving me good results.

- As the range takes some time to heat up, my first step is to set the smallest element on high before I do anything else.

- Next I fill the bottom with cold water as I don't feel like boiling a kettle.  Add coffee and screw Moka together.

- put the Moka on the corner of the coils, so the base has the most coverage.

- As soon as I notice the water start to make some pre-boiling noise, I cut the heat from max -&gt; ""5"" (medium).

- once the coffee starts to erupt I kill the heat entirely, letting the residual heat take it to completion.


As the heat output of these electric ranges take some time to adjust to the setting, I've found this to be a good balance between speed / quality / simplicity

If the coffee eruption starts and heat is too high I've found that it bubbles quickly, and the flow is interrupted prematurely, leading to incomplete extraction.  I started to time things, but if you pay attention you can hear the water talking to you, telling you it is close. :)

Protip: If you miss it and the coffee is flowing quickly, you can lift the Moka pot above the element, this will decrease heat very quickly.

Lastly I don't think there is a more satisfying moment than the noise she makes just as she's about to erupt, hearing it grow and build until it slowly trickles down.  😎",1609872825
Coffee,First time trying the Origami dripper,"Got my Origami dripper from Kurasu today (took less than 3 days to ship from Japan to LA...amazing). I don't know if it's just me but the first cup I made was definitely sweeter and more balanced in comparison to the cup I made earlier using my kalita wave. Same beans, same grinder setting (13 on a Baratza Encore), and same Kalita Wave 185 filters. The kalita produced a slightly more sour and astrigent cup with arguably more distinct flavors but the origami was noticeably sweeter, even as the cup cooled down. Usually I'm rushing to finish my cup, but I could see myself slowing down the drinking experience with the Origami.

Coffee,Keeping Moka Pot Warm?,"Hi all! I received a 5.5 cup Moka Pot for Christmas, and I've really enjoyed it so far. I also got beans from a local roaster that are delicious! However, I am the only one in my house who drinks coffee. I'm not super opposed to drinking the whole pot, because typically I do have \~2 drip coffees a day when I'm at university (and I think the caffeine is somewhat equivalent?), but by the time I'm actually able to get through the whole thing, it's gone cold. This will be a nonissue in three weeks or so when I move back in and I can share with my roommates, but it'll come up again when I move back home for summer. Obviously I can't keep it on the stovetop, but does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep it warm while I'm working through it? Thank you!",1609864535
Coffee,Instant coffee production line,"We run a roastery that has so far focused on freshly roasted coffee beans.

I want to try my hand at making instant coffee out of some of the micro-lot and speciality coffees that we stock.

I am currently finding it a bit difficult to find information on how to go about this!

The roasting side of things is fine, I plan to cold brew the coffee so the extraction should be fine. I believe I need a freeze drier and a Rotovap?

So I would roast the coffee, cold brew it, put it into freeze drier, then when the water is all extracted run it in the Rotovap, and done? Finished product?

Coffee,Breville barista express pressure issues,"Hi,

Wondering if anyone has any insight or prior experience with this—

I’ve got a breville barista express, and lately (almost overnight) it stopped being able to make espresso on the first run of the cycle. It just trickles out a couple drops, and then I have to run it again. It usually creates a normal amount of espresso on the second try (with the same grounds).

I’ve run the cleaning cycle with the tablets twice now, and no luck. 

I thought perhaps the grinding function was acting up and that I was over-filling it with grounds, creating too much pressure, but I dumped some out a few times and still no luck.

Any insights/help is appreciated.",1609861646

Coffee,Need Grinder Recommendations,"Hello!

I am relatively new to the coffee world and recently bought a Moccamaster. My coffee is tasting better already, but my big issue is that I do not have a burr grinder. I have been grinding my beans with a blade grinder, sifting out the larger grinds and regrinding them (I do this about 2-3 times), and running the grinds through a paper towel to catch the finer grinds (thanks James Hoffman). I find this process to be quite tedious and time-consuming to do in the morning, especially when I need to get to work, so I am now in the market for a burr grinder. 

My price range is about $100. I'm really just looking to make a good cup of coffee in the morning without having to spend a long time grinding my beans. Any recommendations??",1609856424

Coffee,French Press vs Strainer,"Currently have an Espro FP but looking to get rid of kitchen items. In theory, it seems that the same FP results can be achieved by simply brewing the coffee in a vessel (e.g. preheated Pyrex measuring cup) and then pouring everything through a fine mesh strainer into the cup right? Seems like less cleanup necessary than with a FP and I can use common kitchen items rather than have a unitasker device like the FP?

The only difference I'm thinking is that glass isn't great for retaining heat so would need to something else in the kitchen and the strainer might not be as fine as a FP. But I'm fine with these two drawbacks of you guys think my assumption is correct.",1609855961

I'm looking to delve into the world of home espresso and get setup with a machine. In terms of grinders I've got the Niche Zero and have been working on filter for the time being but looking to start making some milk drinks.  

So my requirements are mostly:
I want to mostly make milk drinks
Probably one drink a day in the morning
Ideally don't want to do too much temp management (i.e Flair) - Although don't mind waiting for the milk want to heat up etc. 
I don't really want to delve much into the hobbyist world, I just want an enjoyable Cap / Flat White.

My thoughts: 
So far I'm either looking at the Rancilio Silvia or the Delonghi Dedica ec685 (I see people mod this with the Silvia steam wand?) 

My budget is ~£600 - although if this kind of setup isn't going to get me close to high street chain standards (i.e the Costa / Nero / etc (UK) chains) I'd be happy to hold out and take recommendations that'll get me closer to that too.

Coffee,I never knew that a grinder upgrade would make such a dramatic impact!,"Hello hello!

Reminder that having good tools helps a ton. I recently upgraded to a commandante c40, coming from a hario slim, and holy moly was it worth it. Along with that I got a pouring kettle, and that's been great cuz I like preboiling my water before i put it in my bialetti. I'll do a before and after coffee routine so you can have a good laugh at how ridiculously complex things used to be.

Before, to get a mediocre cup of moka, I had to:  
1. Guesstimate the amount of coffee beans, put it in grinder  
2. spend 20 minutes grinding, with the grinder frequently jamming  
3. sift the grounds into a big bowl  
4. grind the left over giant grinds through again  
5. sift that once more, throw away whats left  
6. spread out grounds on paper towel, massage it around to catch the fines  
7. collect grounds in a smaller bowl, throw away the paper towel  
8. Spoon coffee into bialetti basket carefully  
9. put bowl with water into a microwave to boil it, put hotplate on induction hob  
10. spoon boiled water from boil into base, put in coffee basket, screw on the top.  
11. finally place moka pot on hotplate and let it do its thing  
12. cool down base before the fountain starts sputtering and FINALLY get to drink coffee

And even then with all that effort, all I got was a ton of unbalanced extraction. I couldn't get rid of this ""battery acid"" taste that seemed to get into everything i did, and changing grind size on the hario slim never did anything to mitigate it.  
Now, it's so simple, it's laughable.  
1. Weigh out coffee beans on scale  
2. grind in under a minute  
3. flip the grounds into the basket, the commandante jars fit the basket perfectly  
4. Boil water in kettle, heat up induction hotplate  
5. put boiling water in moka, put in coffee basket, screw on the top  
6. moka on hotplate, let it do it's thing  
7. cool down base before fountain starts sputtering and have coffee!

I haven't dialled things in exactly, but the difference in grind quality means that the resulting coffee i've been getting is so much less muddy. A good grinder really goes a long way. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to notice anything, but even just in smell the difference was clear as day. The battery acid taste, gone. The siltiness of the coffee was a lot less, there wasn't as much sand that came up. Thank you guys for guiding me into getting a better grinder, it's brought me a LOT of joy and confidence to keep experimenting.",1609849747

Coffee,Do Kettles and Mugs affect flavor?,"Just when I thought I had explored every rabbit hole on my V60, I’ve got a new one. I was gifted a Stagg stovetop kettle and a Tesla Mug to add to my coffee gear for Christmas, and was quite excited especially for the kettle since I’ve been using a basic Amazon gooseneck kettle up until now. 

But after my first few cups my coffee started tasting incredibly bland and vegetal (think major under extraction). With all my coffees starting to taste bland I actually went and got tested for Covid thinking I might have subtle symptoms of loss of taste. 

One negative test later and a couple weeks of testing, I was able to confirm that the kettle and my mug were making my coffee taste less flavorful. I brewed a number of V60s side by side (new kettle, old kettle, new mug, old mug) and was able to absolutely taste major differences. 

In short, I’ll have to return the Stagg kettle which is a bummer because it’s such a pleasure to use. I’ve tried deep cleaning it multiple times and boiled lots of water in it but the results were still the same.

I tend to prefer very strong brews of coffee, but recently out of politeness to my coworkers, I've been brewing coffee in a French press, and making it less like the grimace-inducing rocket fuel I prefer, which got me thinking.

Here's the question: I've noticed that brewing with too much water (or not enough grounds) results in a cup of coffee that tastes weak, unpleasant, and generally dissatisfying. 

However, brewing stronger coffee and adding hot water, a la Americanos, seems to result in a better-tasting cup, even if the water-to-grounds ratio approaches that of the weak pot of coffee mentioned above.

A bit of background here:

Would appreciate some insight!,"Okay, so last time I asked this I was downvoted to hell, but this seems to be a real phenomenon and I need to know if this is happening to anyone else. Basically: my coffee has been tasting great coming out of my thermals, but tastes like watery/ papery crud when drank at home. 

For example: I was working through this bag of Yellow Honey process from Boy and the Bear Coffee. My first two cups, drank at home, were really cruddy. Exactly as described above. Now, I've been out almost every day since Christmas, and since then that coffee has tasted so good. I get every note on the bag... just this bright, acidic/sweet passion fruit. I figured the small changes I made to my brew fixed the coffee.

Well, had a cup today, first time home in a few weeks... prepared it normally... and back to that watery/ papery/ dry taste. I was floored. 

The ONLY factor that changed was the thermal. Not only that, but I JUST got a new thermal. I had this issue with an old metal one, and thought the metal was doing weird things, but now I have a Frank Green ceramic lined thermal from Onyx. Which is supposed to keep the flavor of your coffee.

So I'm just so confused, but also feel somewhat hopeless. I thought my brews were starting to get consistent... I've had great cups of multiple coffees over the past few weeks... and suddenly they are tasting like crap at home.

Which makes me wonder if I was really tasting my coffee at all, and just making crappy brews the whole time. But... how is that possible? I know what I taste, and these have had very clear profiles. I've had some great cups.

Does anyone have any theories as to what could be happening? Why does keeping my coffee in a ceramic thermal for an hour seem to make this kind of difference?",1609798104
Coffee,Barista Express - how long will it take from cold to being able to make a decent Flat White?,"Hi guys,

Coffee,"American coffee lovers, have you started using Metric measurements more because of coffee?","I've always been aware of metric and used metric measurements from time to time, but when the world around you uses imperial, you think in imperial.

When I got into coffee, though, I found that most guides used metric units. It wasn't an issue for me as I just switched the units my kitchen scale used and started using grams for everything coffee and favoring weight over volume. 

I still use imperial measurements for most things, but when I'm in the kitchen, I start thinking in terms of liters, grams, and Celsius. This thinking is even bleeding into other parts of my kitchen routines. Instead of measuring powders in teaspoons and tablespoons, I use grams. Instead of making 16 ounces of coffee, I make half a liter of coffee.

Voice assistants and coffee calculator apps have been pretty helpful with this too as I'll often be looking at common imperial measurements and converting them to metric (or the nearest neat number). I can commonly be heard saying things like, ""Hey google, how many grams is eight ounces?"" or ""Hey google, how many grams is a cup of broccoli?""

Coffee,French press,"Hi everyone, 
I have a stainless steel French press that I was gifted for Christmas, and I’ve been having some issues getting a proper cup of coffee out of it. I was a barista for 3 years, so I didn’t think this would be that big of an issue.. I grind my beans fresh using a Sboly burr grinder, medium corse, and I’ve been adding more grounds to the press to try and make up for how weak the coffee it produces tastes. I prime the press with hot water every time, let the coffee bloom, and have it extract for about 5 minutes before I push the plunger and pour. Currently using dark roast beans. It tastes like water and a hint of coffee, I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong. Help!",1609795364
Coffee,How strong is my cold brew?,"I use a Bodum cold brew French press, I put 6 cups of water in, and 6 scoops of coffee grounds (each scoop is 1/8 gram) and I brew it for 14 hours room temperature.

Coffee,Adjusting Pourover for Size of Cup,"I found a V60 recipe that I really like (25g coffee, 400g 1:16 water, :30 bloom, 3:30 total) but I'm not sure how to adjust it for more or less coffee. 400 is a little more than I'd like for my personal morning cup (300 ideally) and a little less than I'd like when making a cup big enough to share with my girlfriend (500-600g ideally) 

Which variables do you like to hold constant when changing the total coffee made? 
A) Hold brew time and ratio constant by grinding coarser for larger cups
B) keep ratio constant and grind constant but expect longer extraction/brew time for a 600g cup
C) keep brew time and grind constant but change the ratio
D) something totally different

Is it unreasonable to expect to replicate a recipe for different volumes?",1609793429
Coffee,Pearl S Troubleshooting,"I received the Acaia Pearl S for Christmas and I'm starting to set it up. I'm having a couple of issues that I'm wondering if anyone here knows how to fix:

2)  I can't seem to access any modes except for time/weight and weight. In particular, I'm trying to access flow rate practice mode to get a feel for the proper rate before brewing my first pour over.

Coffee,New Grinder is producing fines,"So I bought a Millwright hand grinder from SAI.  Out of the box, I was super impressed, and for my first couple of grinds, it produced consistent grinds.  I went from a finer pourover grind to a medium coarseness for a french press and I noticed there were some fines caked on the side.  Cup was super muddy but I kept the same coarseness when I went to grind for a drip later, and it still produced some fines.  The majority of the grind was medium coarse though, just to note.  So I made sure I was enough clicks out, and went down to the first click to then count my clicks again (but first I ground some coffee at the first click; idk why I did, I guess just to test out if it could go fine enough for espresso).  So I then went back to the same grind for my drip.  I ground just a few beans just to test and it looked good, but then when I dosed it for a full cup, it produced a ton of fines again.  Will this go away after a few grinds?  Are those fines just the fines that were left over from the previous grind and will they eventually be expelled?  Am I grinding too fast or aggressively (if that’s a thing)?  This grinder seems quite well built, I find it hard to believe this is just a bad grinder.",1609787422

Coffee,Breville Oracle Touch,"The grinder on this machine is questionable. Currently set to a burr of 6 and puck size of 20 grams.

Yesterday, did not change the grind setting, pulled a 35 gram shot. Today, turn it on, on the same grind setting it pulls close to 70 grams. I then retry because I know beans can be fickle (currently using la clombe) and it pulls 80 grams.

Same beans, same grind setting. I work my way down to 20 and it pulls maybe 15-20 grams, bump it up to 21, pulls 28-30 grams.

I wasted close to 100 grams of coffee to not even get close to 2:1.

Secondly, the machine will change the grind setting on it's own over time if powered off long enough. I will turn it off and it says 21 and turn it back on and it says 23

Should I contact breville or has anyone handled these issues before with this machine? It's got to the point where I think I am going to buy a stand alone grinder.",1609786115

Coffee,Retail/Cafe rebranding,"So the company I work for has developed a lot this year. They make high quality award winning shortbread, fudge and other confectionery. We have a flagship retail only store (think Hotel Chocolat), as well as a few cafe style stores serving food and drinks, along side our products.

We may be opening other retail style shop, and are looking at rebranding so the two types of store are more easily distinguishable. Cafes will get a refit to create a more cohesive brand experience.

We're just stuck on a name! What would make sense, not be confusing but also make it clear they are different but part of the same brand

I had no idea it would receive the response it did, and honestly it was just really cool for me to see something I created  be of such interest to people. My “shop” is just my wife and me at home,  and last week we found ourselves making and shipping way more ounces of  tea than we ever imagined needing to make at such an early stage in  this venture (we’re just 3 weeks in!).

We had enough ingredients in the house to make a pound of tea, which normally would last a week, but last week that was not the case. The pound of tea went out to everyone in order, which covered most of you, but there were a few more orders to fill. I have a couple ingredients I cant get locally, and the short version is I hadn't been able to get one of them until today (I first reordered it last week using USPS 2 day, and that didn't make a difference. Then reordered it via Fedex Overnight on Monday, and it arrived this morning). So all remaining orders went  out today. I tried everything I could to get it here sooner but got overwhelmed with orders when I shared it here and it unfortunately  coincided with these unprecedented USPS delays, when at normal time it  would've been here in 2 days...

Being new to this, I've been really preoccupied with this over the last week, and given a couple people checked in with me today, I figured I would just share this situation with you all in case anyone else was  wondering.

Thank you so much to  those who have been understanding about the wait. It's the last thing I  wanted to happen, and I truly had no idea that post would generate more than a handful of inquiries.

Used about 1/2 of a tin 
First taste is toasted, a bit like a well done biscuit. Got a tea pillar in the first brew and cup poured from fairness pitcher. Unfurled most of the way, a smooth steep, as it cools it got a bit of a browned sugar feel on the Back of the throat. Buttery and soft

Second steep 
First sip almost felt like genmaicha, but without quite as much of a clinging butter feel, I can smell the toasted flavor when I exhale after I drink. Not quite as sweet as the first steep. The tannin taste is a bit more noticeable, but not bitter. Slightly vegetal notes linger 

Third steep + four pebbles of rock sugar 
Slight fruit scent, can’t identify what. Less buttery. Less toasted, and a bit of a figgy taste that sticks to the roof of my mouth. So far pleasant. Tannin taste comes out when cooled. Thicker texture than the other steeps

Fourth steep + another sugar pebble
First sip yields less of a toasted taste and instead had a fruit like sweetness, you know when you have the tingly feeling where your molars are with a slightly sour fruit? I had that sensation but no bitterness. It left me thinking about peaches, though I can’t say it tastes like them, maybe more along the lines of sweet plum skin. Settles in to a toasted rice taste. This steep is the best so far and had me salivating more than the others. Not buttery or thick like the others were. 

Fifth steep + another rock
Slightly more of that fruit like feeling, but no bitterness yet. Thin texture. Flavors are starting to fade, might add a few more second on to the next steep and see if that helps. Starting to just fade to a “generic” black tea taste. 

Sixth steep + three small pebbles, 50 seconds 
Less of the fruit feeling, thin, but the taste of tannins faded. Other than that very similar to the fifth. I think I’ve gotten what I can from this tea brewed hot. 

I did half of the tin because when I opened it it was FILLED to the absolute brim, and a full one would’ve taken up more than half of my Gaiwan. I followed the steeping instructions given in the little booklet, and with the leaves leftover I am cold brewing them. 

It took a while for me to finally get around to trying something from this sample as it was making me anxious to “ruin” such a beautiful sampler, but as there are only one other review I found about the teas on the internet I felt as though I should add to them. I’m still new to detailed tea sampling like this, so I hope it all reads alright.

Earlier today, I put a bag of Lipton Black tea into a bottle with 32 oz of room temperature water. It steeped for approximately 2 hours. 

It's now 3:30, so I don't want to drink too much caffeine. I looked up the amount of caffeine per bag of Lipton black tea, and it says 55 mg from a bag steeped in 8 oz of water for 3 minutes.

My question is: How much does steeping time / water temperature affect the amount of caffeine in my tea? Will I be consuming significantly more caffeine because the tea bag was in the water for 2 hours, or because I used 32 oz of water instead of 8?",1608672850

So it's only then i started looking around and remembered i had my slow cooker plugged in probably on the same electric line as the moccamaster, i went back to the original grind size, and moved the slow cooker somewhere else and it solved the problem!

Granted the water wasn't properly heated when both appliances were plugged on the same line, it made me realise how much research and development went into those moccamaster. I'ts incredible they even thought about that, many other coffee makers would have ignored that and caused electrical issues (looking at you precision brewer)

Coffee,Does microwaving a cup of coffee drastically affect its taste and aroma? (As opposed to freshly brewed),"Hi! So I’m a coffee novice, and I got a 2-in-1 blade-grinder and brewer machine for Christmas. I also have different types of beans. I want to start learning how to “taste” different tastes of coffee (I’m learning from James Hoffman), but I need to have two diff. cups of coffee in front of me with two diff. flavors. But in order to prepare both of those, I’d need to:

1. Prepare the beans, coffee filter, and water in the machine
2. Wait for the beans to grind by letting the blade grinder do its thing (2 minutes)
3. Wait 40 minutes for the ground coffee beans to brew
4. Clean the machine (2-3 minutes) to prepare for the next batch of diff. flavor (diff. type of beans)
5. Repeat steps 1-3 to prepare the second batch of coffee, by which time the original batch will have gone cold... by which point I will need to microwave the original batch just so it’s the same temperature as the second batch

I just wanna ask if all of this makes sense. Is it ok to simply microwave the first batch I made to be able to adequately compare it to the 2nd batch i made?

Thank you!!! Any help will go a long way! :)",1609777916
Coffee,Please critique the fuck out of my French press technique,"I thought I had this, and for a while I believe that I did even though I was technically doing everything wrong. Let me first start off by saying that the measurements within my French press are unequivocally wrong. The max line, which is marked as 8 cups? Yeah, that's actually 4. I only realized this a month after getting it, so I was dumping four cups of water onto what was essentially 16 tbs of medium ground coffee (yes, I know, we're getting to that). What I was getting was actually very strong coffee, no doubt due to the sheer quantity of coffee involved.

I recently came into the possession of a coffee grinder, so I said ""look out world, here comes some regulation French press coffee."" First, I realized that I had not eight, but four cups of water to deal with. So I calculated 8 tbs of coarse ground coffee. Here's how I do this:

1. Heat water to boiling in a sauce pan.

2. Measure 8 tbs of freshly ground coffee (coarse) and put in press.

3. After water is boiling, I take it off heat and let sit for 30 seconds.

4. I dump all of the water into the press and stir.

5. I put the lid on for four minutes, then press. Coffee is served.

Problem is, what I'm getting now is very weak. Yes, I should expect it to be weaker than when there were 16 tbs of finely ground coffee for 4 cups of water, but man...that actually tasted great! This tastes watery and thin.

What am I doing wrong here? Is it how I'm adding the water? Do I actually need a scale to measure in grams as I'm reading some people do? Is it as simple as just using more coffee?",1609777332

I used my sette 270 on a setting of 16 E which i usually use for pour over. The brewtime (including drawdown) usually ends around 3:30 min - 4 min.

(More detail)","For several years now I have exclusively used Folgers Instant Coffee packets for all of my coffee needs, this has worked perfectly fine for me and I love how quick and easy it is to make, the little-to-no clean up involved, and honestly I have absolutely zero complaints about the taste/quality of the instant coffee.  But now thanks to a gift from my mother I am now the proud owner of a brand new French press!  The French press is definitely neat and an upgrade, but after using it twice I can’t help but think the process is a bit too time-consuming for my tastes.  On top of the total time to actually make the coffee, there’s also the clean up— which says to clean to the French press after every use, and disassemble + clean + reassemble the mechanism and dry after each use.  The French press is fun and the coffee is pretty good, but it’s become something that just takes up too much time in the morning compared to my instant coffee.  My question is, since I have a fairly large French press, could I make a large quantity of coffee at all once, and then save it in the fridge to drink over the course of 3-4 days?  Will this have any negative impacts on the coffee itself or the caffeine content? Or anything else I should consider?

Before I take this step I wanted to make sure that switching to grinding myself will make a difference. Generally I will buy coffee in bulk, often from a box store with occasional bulk purchases from a roaster.

Coffee,Aftertaste (good one) after drinking decaf espresso.,"I started making espresso recently at home, and I never was into this coffee shop thing before.

I was drinking occasional coffee in the office or on vacations but never had this after taste before.

It's mostly on the outside gums and tongue sides near molars. It's slightly sweet, and something I can't tell, and I start feeling it after an hour-two after drinking, even after brushing teeth or eating some spicy food. Not like I'm trying to get rid of it; I just surprised. It can last for hours. It also comes with feeling like when you want to smoke like nicotine-hungry (I quit like 6 years ago). I bet caffeine is also somewhat addictive, but this happens with decaf, so not sure what it is.

Not sure if I drink a lot of coffee, it's usually a single shot in the morning with caffeine (I can't have a double shot cause I have some weird feeling after it which I don’t like) and a double shot of decaf in the afternoon and somedays
in the evenings also. I make a lot of that steamed milk as well. It's like half of the americano cup is foam. I started noticing it after using 1/2 of the new decaf pack wife got us from Amazon.

Coffee,[Gear][Question][Photo] Dezcal causing staining in stainless steel kettle,"I noticed some scale building up in my Bonavita electric gooseneck, and tried  running some Dezcal through it.   Admittedly, this was my first time using Dezcal, and I poured the powder directly into a kettle full of water (as opposed to mixing a solution first and pouring that into the kettle).

The result was kind of strange...a good amount of scale spots are still present, and now there are dark splotches on the bottom of my kettle visible in the center and on the left on the picture.  

Did I screw up in not mixing the solution, and did I damage the kettle?  Is there a way to get it back to ""normal""?

Coffee,How to replicate Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew Vanilla Cream at home?,"Hey all, as the title reads, I want to replicate the Starbucks Cold Brew Nitrogen infused coffee!

I bought a Nitro Brew System and it's fantastic for nitro brew coffee. I can get the nice cascading bubbles and rich foamy top, but I did some experimenting trying to add cream and I made a nightmare of coffee. When I add cream it comes out very creamy but the bubbles disappear almost instantly. This is not the case when using a cold brew without cream. I also came to learn this is how most nitro cold brews are done, so it's been very hard trying to find online resources that can guide me to adding a milky flavor to my coffee without using artificial syrups.

Like I said before, the reason I want this milky flavor is that I want to replicate the ""vanilla cream"" flavor. Having bought cans of the Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew Vanilla Cream a-plenty, I can observe the bottom of it is not dark and it's actually cloudy and it stays that way which leads me to believe the base is not just straight black coffee and I looked at the ingredients and it shows they do have low-fat skim milk and cream in it!

Any ideas on how they managed to introduce these ingredients in their nitro brew without destroying the cascading bubbles?

The system I am using is one of the 64 oz nitro brew systems seen here if that matters and I am using (2x) 8g N2O whip-its for my brews as instructed.

Coffee,Lelit Anna PL4TEM Pressure Trouble," I bought a Lelit PL4TEM Anna about a month ago and I seem to be having intermittent issues when pulling a shot. I am grinding with a Eureka Mignon Specialita and have been able to dial in just fine. But every once in awhile (every other day or so) when pulling a shot, it will start fine and go to about 10 bars, everything will look fine for about 10 - 15 seconds, then all of a sudden one of two things will happen, the pressure will start dropping rapidly to about 4 bars but there is no increase in espresso coming out or I will hear some kind of click and the pressure will drop to zero, then nothing comes out. When this happens, I stop the pull, remove the portafilter and try to just draw water through the grouphead, usually nothing comes out or it just comes in small drips. Drawing water through the steam wand is fine, no issues there.

I have no idea what is causing this. It's weird because this doesn't happen all the time, I've been using the same coffee, grind and tamp, but its just random in operation.

This is what is happening:  


*Processing video 4fdb9zlc58961...*

 

I sent this video to the company I bought it from, and they said the issue could be not enough power from the electrical outlet. They stated a minimum of 110v on a 20amp circuit. It's on a 120v/20A circuit at the moment. The machine isn't a 20A machine though, it has a 15A plug, unless I am missing something since I am not an electrician.

Coffee,How to improve pour over results at this point?,"Here's what I'm currently doing: I usually am grinding beans from Heart Roasters (currently an Ethiopian) with the following recipe: 

15g beans (ground to 5M on the Baratza Forte BG)

my recipe (v60) is:

* preheat/wet with hot tap water (typically I go to a full boil, 212 F on the Fellow EKG) 
* **0:00-0:45** \- 45g water in and a slight swirl to ensure infusion
* **0:45-1:15** \- additional 105g water in (150g total)
* **1:15-1:45** \- additional 100g water in (250g total), slightly swirl to knock attached grounds. 

I'm just wondering what is my ""next step"" in improving my pour over technique/results? I get decent results usually (maybe a little less fruity than I want sometimes, so I do tend to grind on occasion slightly finer to maybe around 5D). The other variable I haven't played with is water -- I am using city water -- but I don't know how much of a difference it makes + I would want some kind of sustainable way to modify my water source.

Coffee,Hoping for some advice on where to start!,"So to start I drink almost exclusively iced coffee. For the longest I’ve just brewed Foldgers medium in a cheap coffee pot and poured it over ice. My wife is obsessed with the Starbucks Peppermint Mocha grinds we get (she drinks it hot).

I’ve got a cheap French press from IKEA that I use for cold brew sometimes, but I still prefer hot coffee poured over ice.

I want to get into some higher quality coffee. Considering we have it twice a day we may as well enjoy it as much as possible. I’ve browsed around and seen some things about hand grinding, and different methods of brewing and was hoping to get a little input on a couple things.

I love the in-depth, sweet tones that come from cold brewing coffee, so I’m looking for a way to brew it that tones down the bitterness and really brings out the flavor, while still brewing hot so I’m not making separate types of coffee for the two of us.

I don’t mind the manual, more involved aspect of it, so I’d rather go with quality over convenience of use if that makes sense. I’d rather go with higher quality equipment and beans rather than entry level and go up from there.

As far as the coffee itself goes, it may be an oxymoron, but I’m looking for something that is a light-medium roast, that has that sweeter mocha flavor to it. Are there good online retailers for this, or is it better to find a local place to get it from?

tea,"New to Matcha, Looking for Recommendations (crosspost with/r/matcha)","I recently started drinking matcha for both the health and taste benefits, and started with poorly-researched purchases from Amazon (Akira and Encha). Today I received the tin of Ummon that I ordered from Ippodo for a comparison, and I am blown away by the taste, the quality, and the difference in physiological response/energy that I get out of it.

With that said, I'm looking for a daily drinking matcha. I drink usucha with nothing added to it, usually two to three times per day. I've read other threads with recommendations, and I have some Aoarashi and Isuzu coming from Marukyu Koyamaen (courtesy of Sazen) to try, but I wanted to check here to see if there are any recommendations for a good daily drinker to keep on hand considering that I'm likely to go through about 60g every two weeks or so.

My current list of possibilities is as follows:

Aoarashi, Isuzu, Wako (Marukyu)

Kan no Shiro, Sayaka no Mukashi (Ippodo)

The Sayaka would be a bit of a budgetary stretch - I'm looking for that price point or lower - but I REALLY like the way that the Ummon is feeling in terms of energy and the taste was great, so that leads me to strongly consider Ippodo.

Something about them just tastes off compared to the ones I like (Ahmad, Alreef, Harney, even Biggelow and Tazo if I have nothing else) with a faker, more perfumed taste that has made me wonder if it’s even earl grey- the first time I had some of them I had to find bergamot on the ingredients list to realize. Not to say I don’t like one once in a while, I’ve just always thought they were off. 

I’ve also had a vendetta against Twinnings earl grey for a long time for the exact same reason, but after returning from college it was the only earl grey here and I wanted some. 

It took me til today to realize a lot of places probably use Twinnings earl grey. Same weirdness in the bergamot flavor, it comes “looseleaf” and fairly cheap, and it’s easy to find as a source. I’m sure in bulk it’s even cheaper to get.

 TeaGuardian seems to claim that White tea and Sheng are produced in an essentially identical manner (prior to compression and aging for the Sheng) in so far as both are withered and dried after plucking without roasting--and thus undergo some oxidation. However, other sources seem to imply that Sheng Puer is actually more like a Sun-dried Green Tea, insofar as the latter has a pan-roasting enzyme arresting step prior to being sun-dried. Even wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea\_processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_processing)) claims that Sheng is ""fixed"" prior to drying in its chart here. 

The few Sheng's I've had all had some years on them but some had more ""green"" characteristics and others had more ""white"" characteristics to my palate. Perhaps BOTH means of processing are used in different cases, or maybe there is a third way or other differences that I am totally unaware of. There also seems to be another variable in terms of how densely the green leaves are piled for sun-drying--the denser the piles the less enzyme fixation would occur. 

If anyone has any insight I would be grateful as the problem has been obsessing me and most websites just parrot claims with no evidence or detailed commentary.",1608445723

tea,Can't seem to find the sweet spot for oolongs,"My oolongs smell wonderful, but they either taste like nothing or get bitter.

I have five different oolongs from Song Tea. I'm using Absopure brand spring water to brew them. I've tried following the instructions for tea amount, time, and temp; short gaiwan steeping with lots of leaf; hotter water; cooler water; short steeps; long steeps; increasing steeping time; keeping steeping time the same over multiple steeps; using a teapot; using an IngenuiTea. Nothing seems to bring out any actual flavor except bitter, and then a faint sweet aftertaste.

I use a Cuisinart electric kettle to heat the water. The teas all have suggested brewing temps of 205 or 208 F, but the kettle has 200 and Boil settings with nothing in between. I've tried using the Boil setting and pouring the water into another container before pouring it over the leaves, and I've tried just using the 200 setting. I've also tried Boil straight from the kettle in the name of experimentation. Which setting I use doesn't seem to make nearly as much difference as steep time, but in any case my tea is either flavorless or bitter. None of the fruit/cocoa/molasses/whatever notes the package claims - although, like I said, they *smell* wonderful and distinct.

I thought maybe smell was actually all there was to it, and then I tried some wild tree purple tea from Yunnan Sourcing and was blown away by how it tasted (and posted here about it a short while back). Intense dark fruit, wood, and honey notes with an unreal sweet finish. So either there's a *drastic* difference between black and oolong, or else I'm brewing it wrong, somehow.

Coffee,Chemex Advice for Light Roasts,"I'm new to third wave coffee and bought a chemex a month ago.  Until now I had been brewing darker espresso roasts and really enjoyed the output after dialing it in, however recently I've switched to lighter roasts (Guatemalan single origin from Blue Bottle and Holler Mountain from Stumptown).  I feel like I'm not extracting right/enough as I can't seem to dial these coffees in.  

The coffee comes out a little more sour (though not excessively so) and kind of empty feeling for lack of a better word.  It's not terrible, but I can't tell if I need to change my technique or if I just don't enjoy lighter style roasts.  There's zero bitterness ever, no matter how much I try to overextract (in an attempt to dial in properly).

Technique:

-Oxo Burr grinder on 5-6 (significantly finer than my darker roast settings, which are a 9).  I've tried James Hoffman advice of going grinding finer until you hit a bitter wall then back off, but I never seem to hit it with these roasts.  With the darker roasts it was clear as day when I needed to back off.  This lack of bitterness makes me suspicious that I'm continuing to underextract.

-Gooseneck kettle set at 205f

-two pours after bloom (James Hoffman v60 style), sometimes 3

-400g of water to 24.5g of coffee.

-brew times are between 4 and 5 minutes.


Do you guys have any tips for getting more out of my light roasts?  Should I continue to grind finer, brew times be damned?  

Perhaps my days of drinking horribly bad, sludgy French press has made me enjoy a different style of brew and I should just stick to darker roasts?  

I just want to make sure I'm giving them a proper chance before I give up on lighter style roasts.",1609693967
Coffee,Trouble with uKeg Nitro,"Hello all,

I was lucky enough to get a uKeg Nitro for Christmas. I’m a sucker for coffee/beer on nitro so this was a great gift. However, I’m having trouble getting the perfect strength and pour. I followed per the instructions and it seems like the coffee is very weak. I also can’t seem to get the nitro infused pour down either. I tried adding ice during the infusion process and I even left the cap to “infuse” while it’s been in the refrigerator. But each pour comes out looking like a regular cup of coffee with just a little bit of foam on the top. Any suggestions?",1609693820
Coffee,Suggestion for homemade cappuccino without machine: use evaporated milk,"I like my coffee black but I do sometimes crave a nice frothy cappuccino. 

Evaporated milk is perfect for coffee. Basically it's milk with half its water removed. From the process of dehydration, it's been already heated, therefore it's already as sweet as steamed milk. And since it's dehydrated, it's perfect for non-concentrated coffee, such as drip or french press. And even better, it's super easy to froth it up since it's more viscous than normal milk.

I did this with french press coffee and it tasted very close to a cappuccino. It's not perfect, but imo it's the best alternative for someone who only owns a basic french press or a drip machine or v60 and can't have a means of making concentrated or espresso coffee. 

Worked great with a moka pot americano as well.

Moral of story, if your coffee is not concentrated, make sure your milk is concentrated instead.",1609693352

Coffee,Questions Tasting Notes and Flavor Wheel,"I've read many wonderful posts here about tasting notes.
For the past year, I've been buying various subscription services from local roasters (I live in Japan and regularly use [ABC Coffee](http://abccoffee.co/?lang=en)).
The wonderful thing about these roasters is that they provide flavor notes, but I'm having a hard time relating to them. And so, I decided to create my own tasting notes for all the coffee I brew.

Some of the posts I took note of are:
- [Resources/Advice on tasting?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/k2gmor/resourcesadvice_on_tasting/)
- [Tasting notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/kgx4in/tasting_notes/)

I'm using the [flavor wheel](https://counterculturecoffee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCC_FlavorWheelPoster-2.pdf) that everyone on here seems to be using, but I can't recreate the tastes that these roasters label them as. One redditor said to base everything on what you eat every day, and that does make sense. It's just that I don't really taste all the flavors these roasters labels them as.

My questions are:
- What are the standard methods of coffee tasting?
- What methods do you guys prefer?
- What do you base the flavors off of (e.g., adjectives &amp; intensifiers for coffee are very confusing like ""Structured"", ""Delicate"", etc.)

Coffee,Is there supposed to be a bunch of coffee left in the filter after brewing?,"New coffee maker here! I got a coffee machine for Christmas ([this Hamilton Beach one](https://hamiltonbeach.com/2-way-brewer-49980z), to be specific), and I love it. It’s so easy to use, and the coffee tastes great. And what I love most about it is that it has both a single-serve side and a carafe side, so I don’t have to make coffee in the carafe if I just want one cup. (This really reads like an ad, doesn’t it?)

I’ve never used the carafe side, only the single-serve side, and while the coffee _does_ always taste great, it also always leaves a bunch of ground coffee left in the filter. [**Here’s a picture I took.**](https://i.imgur.com/ILZLlZs.jpg) I’m completely new to coffee-making, so I have no clue if it’s supposed to do this. I had the impression that the filter should be more or less empty once it’s done brewing, but that’s not what’s happening to me. The amount of wet ground coffee left in the filter after the coffee is done brewing looks to be almost as much coffee as I put into it in the first place.

Am I doing something wrong, is my coffee maker defect, or is this just how it’s supposed to work? I mean, the coffee tastes perfectly fine, so maybe this is a non-issue? I dunno.

This has happened every time, by the way. I always just put one or two level teaspoons of ground coffee in the filter when making a single cup since that’s what the manual told me. And I just use the included permanent filter—no paper filters or anything (AFAIK, you’re not supposed to use a paper filter in a permanent filter). Oh, and if it matters, I bought pre-ground coffee since I don’t have a coffee grinder, although I did order one, and it’s on its way, so soon, I’ll be grinding my own coffee, which I’m pretty excited about. I heard it makes a big change in taste (and also how long it lasts, which is nice, because I’m pretty sure the coffee I bought last year is already stale).",1609677382

Second, when I found a good coarse grind setting, while grinding, the knob will turn on its own. It takes a tighter screw-in setting to settle on a position where it won't do this, but I feel that it's not as coarse, and I still get some fine grinds in the mix, too.

Coffee,Problem with Baratza Vario,"Hi guys.

I am having some problems with a brand new Baratza Vario grinder. 

The problem is that the machine is compacting the ground coffee in the output chute and the coffee is getting stuck inside the grind chamber. It seems the coffee is stuck to the sides of the output chute. Could this be due to static electricity and a huge build up of grounds as a consequence choking the grinder?

I have tried declogging the coffee chamber multiple times and leaving the grinder opened to dry up in case moisture is causing the problem (humidity in my area 30-40%). 

Just to be clear I am currently using a grind setting of 4, so not grinding at the finest possible.

Coffee,"Breville Barista Express help, feel like I'm going mad","I've have a BES870XL machine which is two  years old. I'm certainly no coffee expert at all, but I have been able to make what I would consider better tasting coffee than most coffee shops I've been to, until recently,

Recently the newer machine changed behavior and I can't for the life of me get a good shot out of it.

Before the change:

* I always buy the same beans from Trader Joe's "" Five Country Espresso Blend"" (don't judge me!)
* Grind was set to about 1 on the conical burr grinder (finest).
* I always use the single-wall double shot basket
* I tamp using the provided tamper, not too hard or soft
* I use the ""razer"" thing that comes with the machine to make sure the dose is perfectly flat and the right amount.
* Stick the portafilter in the machine, hit double shot, and after the pre-infusion, I would see the pressure gauge at about the 75% mark in the ""espresso range"" (about 12 o'clock vertical), water would flow slow and steady and I'd see gold crema.

Then one day everything changed:

* With the exact same beans the pressure was now off the top of the scale, water just dripped out and the shot was extremely bitter.
* I adjusted the grind down lower, but then it was running too fast.
* I stepped back up and eventually ended up back at setting 1 (the finest)
* Now the pressure is the same as before the change (!?) but the water flows much faster and the shot smells and tastes under extracted. Basically it's gross.  


I called Breville support who talked me through testing if the right amount of water was coming out when the single and double shot buttons are used; it is. They also told me that if my beans were roasted more than a month ago that could be causing it, but that doesn't really explain the sudden change. They also got me to use the dual-wall basket to try and dial in the grind, but it was all over the place, with the pressure getting lower as we made the grind finer 🙃. The lady told me that you should almost never need to go lower than 4/6 on the grind setting, but we've never been able to make good shots without the machines being on setting 1.

At the end of the call, she said she couldn't service it as the water amount and pressure were correct.

So TL;DR, my machine now makes terrible coffee, I don't know what to do apart from pay a lot of money to have someone come and fix it.

Sorry if this post is too long (first time posting), or misses important details, but I'm pretty desperate now!

Coffee,Anyone have a Ninja CE251?,"Anyone out there have a Ninja CE251? I'm looking to purchasing one but I am hesitant because of issues I've had with my current Ninja. Just bought a different brand of machine but it doesn't taste like the Ninja.

I have been able to work my way around them each time turning the machine upside down and getting the excess water out but I have been unable to take apart the machine like in other YouTube videos I have seen.

My machine has T10 security screws and I can get some of them off.. but there are some that are buried in a long shift and I can't get to those nor have I been able to find a tool to unscrew those screws. I have a longer T10 screw driver that reaches but it is the wrong T10 and I cannot for the life of me find a long, thin screwdriver with the right T10 bit. My security bit is too thick to fit in the shaft. Does anyone have a CE251 and could show me the underside so I can see if it can be taken apart?",1609636832

It has a 30second grind function, so I hit the button and kept on preparing my French press... and didn't realize that the cup it dispenses the grinded coffee into had filled up toward the end - so basically for ~5 secs or so, the coffee grinds were getting clogged at the opening of the dispenser if that makes sense, because the cup they are supposed to dispense into was backlogged.

I mostly drink black coffee made from a brewer. As I said I'm not an expert and just use ""powder coffee"" (I'm not a native speaker so I don't know the word, but I DON'T mean instant coffee!!!). I've been drinking coffee for about 2 years now, but recently I've become more aware of the way it tastes. I started thinking that something was off. The coffee barely had any taste. I mean, it was not like water, but I couldn't really taste it? When I tried different brands or coffee powders, I didn't notice much of a difference. I assumed something must be wrong and tried to fix it:

I descaled the brewer. I tried to use the carafe side instead of single-cup side (my brewer has one of each). I bought paper filters instead of using a reusable one. I became ridiculously careful about the way I put the coffee in the filter. But even after trying so many things, I didn't notice much of a distance.

Not until yesterday... I haven't eaten breakfast in a while but today I made some containing things like oatmeal and peanut butter and made a cup of coffee as well. Guess what? I could taste the coffee ""for real"" again. Then I had a cup in the afternoon without any food and once again, the coffee was almost tasteless. Today I tried the breakfast thing again and once again I could taste the coffee. 

What is this? Is it normal? It's kinda frustrating. I love the way the coffee tastes when I have it to my breakfast, I can feel the ""fruitiness"" and all, but when I have it without food it's almost tasteless??? 

Also, it's not covid. I haven't noticed any changes with other foods, I can still taste them.",1609634770

Coffee,Cleaned up an old drip brewer I had in the house.,"Long ago, my family started using a Keurig to make coffee. Certainly its convenience at home is unmatched, so our drip machines went away to collect dust.

Recently I got into specialty coffee and took an interest in making better coffee in general. I'm not worried about making the perfect cup of coffee, but my standards are much higher than they used to be. After trying a wide variety of brew methods, especially pour over, I wanted to apply what I've learned to a drip machine.

I know the cheap dripper won't give me the control over all the variables but at least it's consistent. 

I tried clearing a Mr coffee, but it was too far gone to be worth it. I had better luck with the Gevalia.

I ran a vinegar and water mix through it and otherwise gave it a good cleaning, then I figured out how much water it poured in 5 minutes which happened to be about a liter or just over 4 US cups.

I rinsed a filter, gound 60g of coffee, and started the brew. To avoid scorching the coffee, I took the carafe of the hot plate as soon as it finished brewing.

The brew turned out better than I expected, but obviously not as good as a controlled pour over. The coffee bed wasn't flat, so extraction was probably not very even.

Coffee,"Is the ""Brew It Within Two Weeks Post-Roast"" recommendation outdated?","Home brewing has been a hobby of mine since about 2015. When I first began, it seemed that the common wisdom (perhaps misinterpreted by me?) was that coffee was at its best freshly ground and brewed within two weeks post the roast date. 

Lately, I've seen a trend on here, and other coffee related internet material, that nope, in fact a coffee can be just as enjoyable several months after roast date. 

I've still mostly stuck to the within-two-weeks mantra, as I have certainly experienced that if I occasionally brew several months after buying (maybe the last remnants of a bag I had forgotten) that those cups really don't sparkle. 

And then today I brewed [this Guatemalan Gesha from PTs](https://www.ptscoffee.com/collections/single-origin-coffee/products/santa-ana-gesha-natural) coffee and made the best cup I've ever made. The roast date was 11/10, over a month-and-a-half ago. Back when I purchased and received the coffee (just a few days after the roast date) I simply couldn't make the coffee shine no matter how I adjusted my Comandante to brew with my V60. 

Maybe I just happened to hit my grind and technique parameters correctly today...but I'm starting to wonder if, for certain coffees, (maybe naturals?) that not only does the two week rule not apply, but some coffees might even taste better when you wait a couple months?

Coffee,Why was my Christmas coffee so good?,"So I went to my parent’s house for a week over Christmas and had some of the most exciting cups I’ve had in ages, and I’ve been wondering what in particular made me like it so much.

At home I usually make a V60 with beans I get through a subscription service (so freshly roasted etc) which I grind using a Hario mini mill plus. The main issue I’ve identified here is the Hario grinder which as many will know is wildly inconsistent and for me typically produces a cup which is both under and over extracted.

For the Christmas wondercup I bought a bag of beans from a different roaster which a friend had recommended to me. These were ground using a cheap electric burr grinder I bought my Dad a couple of years ago, and then brewed with an Aeropress.

I can honestly say the first cup I made (in which I barely knew what I was doing with the Aeropress) was one of my favourite home coffee experiences and I immediately tasted all of the tasting notes from the roaster. 

So what was the single biggest impact here? Was it the new brewing method? The more consistent grind (although still far from perfect)? The beans? Or was it just that everything was vastly different to my usual cup? Very interested to hear people’s perspectives on this exciting experience!

If you recommend replacing, is there anything in the range of moka pots you can recommend? I mainly use it for making ""espresso"" for cappuccinos and lattes at home.

Current set up: Black and Decker drip coffee maker (~$50.00) and Hamilton Beach single blade grinder (~15.00). Bought these three years ago and it made a huge difference over the pre ground coffee I was buying. I get my beans locally.

Needs: Coffee for work (to be put in Stanley thermos) and weekends, so daily use. I do enjoy the process of using my French press and have watched the pour over process and could see myself getting into that, however the BPP looks like a good mix of quality and ease for those work mornings.

Coffee,Flavored coffee in grinder?,"TLDR: My wife drinks flavored coffee and I drink regular, unflavored coffee. I just bought a Baratza Encore. Is there a way we can both use it without the flavored bean residue impacting the regular beans?

I've been making pour overs for my wife and I everyday for years - a standard, locally roasted, medium or light coffee for me and a locally roasted flavored coffee for her. She's tried the ""craft"" coffees that I prefer many times and always prefers the richness and spice of the flavored coffees. (And I get it, these coffees are delicious for holidays or freezing winter afternoons. But I prefer brighter, simpler cups for general consumption.)

I bought my first real grinder last week - a Baratza Encore. Before this, we were pre-grinding the coffee when we bought it at shops. I was excited to upgrade both my cup and hers with freshly ground coffee! 

But I soon remembered that the shop where she gets her flavored coffee grinds these beans SEPARATELY from the unflavored beans. I did some internet research and realized this is because the syrup/flavoring can ""mess up"" the burrs or ""contaminate"" all the coffee that goes through it. I have yet to try grinding any of her coffee because I don't want to risk a residue buildup that affects the coffee for a long time. Really bummed that I can't enhance my wife's coffee experience with this purchase and don't want to buy another grinder. She admits (and I agree) that I care more about the ""science of the perfect cup"" more than she does.

So, is there a way that I can grind both her flavored coffee and my unflavored coffee in the same grinder? I understand there are ways to clean the burrs. Can this cleaning remove the residue from the flavored beans? Would love your input and to learn from your experience! Thanks!",1609596840

Coffee,Goose-neck variable temperature kettle above ~2KW?,"Hi everybody,

# Some background explaining features I seek

I'm a big tea drinker and in the past few months I had the honor tasting some pretty good pour over coffees which made me a coffee person too.

I am making the leap, buying Chemex (still deciding between 6 and 8 cup version - living alone, drinking about 400-500ml / 13-17oz a session), thinking about Wilfa Uniform as a a burr grinder (probably will get Hario standard mcs-1 for starting out).

**I would also like to upgrade my electric kettle, since I am already treating myself.** 

* **Variable Temperature**: Since the teas I am drinking are mostly dark (ripe pu'erh), I will be using mostly boiling water, but in the evenings I am trying to drink green teas (Dragonwell), where variable temperature comes in handy. 
* **Goose-neck:** For pour over coffee you pretty much want boiling water too, but also having a goose-neck kettle. The temperature hold is a killer feature, but it kind of comes given with a variable temperature and vice versa.

# Some products I have considered

* Fellow Stagg EKG
* Brewista ARTISAN
* [Doctor Hetzner  (2200W)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Electric-Temperature-Gooseneck-Pour-Over-Stainless/dp/B07JVNMC4Q)

I love the looks of the Fellow kettle, it has nice features and I have read some praises of you guys, how fast it boils the water and is overall amazing product. I nearly made the purchase when I noticed it has only 1200W. My current (old) electric kettle is 2400W. It gets cold tap water (900ml) to boil in about 160 seconds. Considering using only half the power, I can not say 5 and a half minutes is a fast time to boil water in the Fellow.

So I searched for some alternatives, first finding the Brewista. If I don't consider the touch controls (which I hate), it has even less power at 1000W (one site claims 1500W for the 0.9L ARTISAN, but I believe it is a typo, since everywhere else it says 1000W).

Last is the Doctor Hetzner thing. It is currently unavailable and who knows if it ever will be in stock again. Not even touching on the subject of it being ugly as hell.

Now I understand, making a great cup coffee and tea is kind of a ritual for most of us. But I am not using the kettle just for these occasions. I also use hot water when cooking, or even for some bagged tea in a thermo mug, when in a hurry. For the cooking bit I guess I could but a basic kettle on a gas stove pot, but it is just not convenient.

Coffee,Moccamaster issues after cleaning,"  

I bought my Moccamaster Select half a year ago and it soon became my favorite home appliance. I used it approximately every other day and after 100 brews, I decided to clean and descale it as suggested. After that, I noticed some noises sounds coming out of my brewer. During heating up, right before it starts „bubbling“ I can hear some humming and vibrating and after that, clicking sounds. I'm pretty sure I didn't hear any of these sounds before I did the cleaning and descaling. 

Also, when I flush rest of the water out of the reservoir, I can hear some rattling. I wasn’t doing this before cleaning since I was using my brewer regurally, so I don’t know if it’s normal or if it’s something that happened later. 

Coffee that comes out of it tastes very good as always, but I'm afraid if everything is fine with the machine as I don´t want it to break later. Should I send it for repair?

Coffee,First Time Owner/User of Coffee Machine Here,"Hi, so I've recently bought my own coffee maker, specifically the SYCM-006 (Sboly Brand) and I've noticed an issue that I can only call ""Burnt Plastic Smell"" whenever the water is beginning to heat. I've owned an electric tea kettle that would let off a distinct ""boiling"" smell that water lets off (bottled water was used for both cases) and was wondering if this was true?   


I've followed the cleaning instruction and done so a total of three times, even allowed it to boil with just water to let it clean that way as well, and noticed the burnt smell in all cases. I've inspected the water reservoir and all other components and do not see any ""extra packing material"" anywhere, be it tape, padding, and any other thing. So, is this just me being paranoid and haven't used it enough to let it be ""broken"" in long enough to have it stop producing that smell when heating up?

My only other concern that I am right in my paranoia thinking this unit is defective is because my life-long headaches have gotten a lot more severe and I've gotten a stomach ache on my third (one 14oz serving per day so far). This leads me to believe it is defective because of the smell. Even when boiling straight bottle water, I do not taste anything in the resulting hot water in terms of taste (burnt plastic is very obvious in terms of taste).

So any other insight from others who own a K-Cup type coffee machine will be much appreciated. I've thus far stopped using it and am waiting for the company to reply, which they've mysteriously stopped replying to my questions on this topic. 

Also, I will most likely be sending this unit back for a refund and going to an in-person store to skip the wait/deals. Because of this, does anyone have any suggestions for a brand/model of a cheap/simple K-Cup style coffee machine?

Coffee,Help! Frustratingly whelming pour overs,"Hi r/coffee, I’ve hit a wall and figured this would be the best place for help! I’ve been into speciality coffee for a little over a year now, brewing exclusively pour over. 

Every time I have a new bag of beans, I brew a French press using the Hoffmann method to get a good sense of the flavor of the beans, and have gotten some fantastic cups from it that are really exciting, but when I try making cups with pour over, they’re just not the same and are underwhelming, so I definitely think it’s my brewing method. 

Current gear: Comandante C40, v60, Kalita 185, scale accurate to 0.1g and a gooseneck kettle, use distilled water with TWW

Here’s what I usually do and have tried:
• Scott Rao’s updated pour over method with 20g:340g (1:17) in my v60 and Kalita (was getting fantastic results at first, but last few bags have been meh)
• 3x bloom, then 3 pours at 70g, 90g, and 120g, waiting to drain about halfway before the next pour
• Using Coffee Compass to adjust the grind after (for Scott Rao, I’ve gone anywhere from 15-24 clicks, and for the 3 pour, between 20-26 clicks)
• Decreasing/increasing the ratio between 1:-6 and 1:18
• Playing with water temperature between 90-99 C

Usually I try to change only one variable at a time, but I have felt like I haven’t been really unlocking the potential of any of the last 3-4 bags of beans I’ve had. Each cup has not been comparable the flavor I’ve gotten from the French press and I know a v60 and kalita can produce really phenomenal cups.

Coffee,My plain coffee mug broke ☕️,"I’m writing this just to vent, please bear with me, it’s a short story:

I consider myself a coffee aficionado. Love the flavor of black coffee, the process to brew it, the smell and the caffeine kick. I love to travel too, so I started collecting coffee mugs from wherever I traveled.

Since I didn't want to damage my “precious” collection, I bought a $1, plain, white coffee mug. I used it almost everyday for the last close to 8 years.

Today, after staying late celebrating new year's eve, I woke up extremely tired and a little hungover. I needed my coffee, I rushed to the kitchen, mechanically reached my mug cabinet, and when I was washing my mug, it slipped through my fingers directly to the floor. 

2021 is not starting nice with me. It sounds stupid how we get attached to insignificant things, but still I lost my best morning friend. 

I know Covid taught us way more than my stupid incident, but this reminds me of a couple of things:

1. We assign the real value to all our things, my $1 mug became way more valuable to me than the rest of my collection simply because I got attached to it.

2. Everything is temporary, enjoy it while you can and don't get too attached. Go and enjoy life (and coffee).",1609546983

Coffee,Mapping clicks between Comandante C40 and 1Zpresso JX (non Pro),"Many recipes reference number of clicks on a Comandante, since it’s so popular. I’d like to reference those when dialing in my JX. 

I have found through some searching here that 1 click on the Comandante is 30 microns. 

The 1Zpresso site lists the JX as 0.025mm per click (25 microns). 

Here’s what’s not making sense to me: 22-32 clicks (660-960 microns) is the common guidance for pour overs on the Comandante. For the JX that would be equivalent to 26-38 clicks, which is extremely fine and is close to the Espresso range on their grind chart. 60-90 clicks is the pour over range on their chart. 

Is my math wrong, or have I been brewing way too coarse this entire time? I am more around 75-90 clicks on a 400g:25g batch on a Kalita 185 (using Hoffmann method) and the brews finish around 3:30. I can’t imagine going that much finer wouldn’t result in stalling or a ton of bitterness, but I plan to try it.

So my question is does anyone know of any reasonably prices reusable coffee pods that work well, and what sort of coffee should I buy, I assume the ground coffee packs for cafetiere are not fine enough, so would I have to buy beans and a grinder?

Coffee,To Flair or not to Flair,"Hello! I've been obsessed with coffee for a couple of years now, and while being an Italian my first spark of curiosity was towards drip and filter coffee. I've been experimenting with a V60, my beloved Aeropress, the reliable french press and the occasional Moka pot. I have a Baratza Encore grinder and all is going great. I'm not the biggest fan of espresso, and I still don't have the budget to buy the right equipment. Also it's easy to find really good espresso in several bars around Milan. 

My question is, i would like to have something to do a pretty standard espresso to use with lattes, of for the occasional Italian relative who doesn't want to drink my """"""""american"""""""""" coffee. I laid eyes on the Flair Neo, both for aesthetic and functionality. I've seen that having a Baratza Encore that's not suited for espresso grinding it's better to go towards the Neo that the Flair Pro, of other better version, does someone have good experience with this combo? 

Also, am I making any sense? 😂

Thanks in advance",1609537988

However, anytime I do this-even if I put the grinder on the same setting that it was on before-my next few batches of coffee will come out tasting sour.

When younger and trying to reduce sugar intake, soda, etc, I used to think adding honey also added the flavor of honey and was a win-win. Two good flavors in one cup, so better than sugar.  But recently I’m finding that it makes the tea bland. Can’t fully taste the tea OR honey. And they both taste fine on their own. I actually just used this to my advantage, I tried some tea that I was a bit iffy on the flavor. After honey, the iffy flavor is gone.


A few years ago I had a pretty bad flu/cold that nuked my sense of taste and smell and I’m not sure if I’m back to 100% or not. So I thought I’d ask people to see if it’s just a me problem. Maybe I outgrew my childhood tastes and the difference was always there, or it’s my damaged nose. Thanks!",1608399361

I live in the UK and before today the only Matcha I've had was one from Holland and Barrett, this was before I knew what good quality matcha was so this was just a dull grey colour which tasted horrible if it wasn't served with milk.
Fast forward to a few days ago and I purchased 2 different types of Matcha from Matchaeology; the Misaki and the Matsu which was part of the brewing kit. Anyway, it arrived today so I decided to make myself some using the Misaki and I have to just say Holy shit have I been missing out.

I recently bought some pu’er tea, mostly on a whim. I did not do a lot of research before hand and just ended up getting the mighty leaf brand from my local Peet’s Coffee. I’ve brewed it (following the instructions: boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes, rinse once before brewing) twice now and I am just not a fan. I ended up icing the tea and like it better that way especially with a wedge of lemon. Is this pu’er blasphemy? Perhaps, but that’s why I’m here. I was looking for some advice on alternative ways to brew it. 

I am a big green tea drinker and LOVE floral stuff like jasmine and the grasser sencha stuff. The pu’er was just too earthy for me. I felt like I was drinking a really earthy dirt/ mushroom flavored tea. I know that’s probably the nature of the tea and a  result of the fermentation process but I’d appreciate some advice on how to tamp down on those flavors, any other flavors I could add, or even just your favorite way to brew pu’er.

tea,I have possibly the worst idea ever and Im gonna do it!,"Ok so the standard when dealing with teabags is you put one in your cup let it steep for however long you like, take it out and you're done. Most people don't drink tea for the caffeine content. I personally don't but I do enjoy a good boost of caffeine. My idea while most defiantly terrible is to put a large amount say 6-10 maybe more teabags in one cup let it steep and then use this super concentrated concoction as a kind of quick way to make tea. I can heat up a mug of water pour in a small amount of my concentrated tea and I have tea quickly and easily with possibly a higher caffeine content skipping the whole steeping process(a process that takes no more than 5 minutes). Now this is a terrible idea but thats often the most fun kind of idea so I am going to do it. I will make an update post on my findings into this venture. Its very possible no one will care and at most two people will see this and be like ""ha loser"" but nevertheless life has tempted me with the most delicious flavor of experience, a quite terrible idea and I intend to cease upon the opportunity presented by my quite terrible mind.

Coffee,Struggling with Dark Roasts Lately (Breville Drip and Baratza Virtuoso),"Hey fam! I received a few bags of dark roasted coffee around the holidays and have been struggling to get them to where I think they should. I find the taste and flavors to be rather dull and almost dry? My gear includes and Breville Precision Brewer along with a Baratza Virtuoso grinder. I know that all burr grinders are not created equal, but if I had to guess, I think this may be where the issue lies. 

I've had pretty good luck with light roasts around the 12-13 setting, and I've read that dark roasts should be grind at a coarser setting. Should that be one tick up to a 14-15 setting? Or should it be more around like a 22-23? In terms of temperature I have my Breville dialed in at 207 (F) for light roasts. This should be lower for dark roasts, correct? Any recommendations on a temperature? 

Should I just stick to French Press when it comes to Darker beans?",1609523979

I’ve also done my fair share of mechanical engineering projects building robots. 

I’m going to build an espresso machine that uses an instantaneous water heater, so I can get coffee brewing at the press of one button in the morning, without waiting for a boiler to heat up. (However, ill still be using a small boiler for steam, seeing as it’s easier and cheaper to build. 

My real question is stemming from power supplies. I’m either looking at using a PC power supply and doing a lot of extra work to thing operate smoothly.....

Or I’m using rechargeable battery packs as my power source. This option would make it super easy. I can get some 24V hobbyist batteries, and some 12V batteries and make it easy to swap them in and out.

Coffee,"Sour pourover, long drawdown time","Columbian beans from local roaster I've never tried--they don't do V60 pourovers. I tried a cappuccino and thought it was pretty good (I have no experience with roasters and new to coffee). I asked and was told the beans were roasted 4 days ago.

Did pourover, it came out sour:

* Niche Zero setting 40 yesterday--sour aftertaste. Today, setting 50 (coarser)--consistent sourness came out sooner. Normally, I use ~55-58 drinking only cheap-ass commercial brand of coffee which is my current baseline as a noobie (it is just suitable/slightly preferable over Dunkin' Donuts I guess).

* Drawdown on setting 40 is ~4:50+ (hence why I went coarser the second time), setting 50 is ~4:30. So I don't think I should be going finer despite sourness. Can going coarser actually help with sourness? 

* I'm already using as hot water as possible, probably too hot (99-100C). I have no idea how quickly water temp drops and for a non-preheated glass V60 size 1.

* 17g of coffee, 34g bloom for 45s, 1:17 coffee:water.

* Using [Nature's Promise Size 2 Coffee filters](https://www.instacart.com/products/17012103-nature-s-promise-2-coffee-filter-100-ct-100-0-ct), rinsed under hot tap water. If I have to change any products involved, I would probably try Hario V60 filters which seems to be the ""standard"".

* Technique: I just did Hoffmann's technique. The the second time I did the pourover, I swirled more vigorously, guessing channeling might be an issue. Flat bed at the end.

What should I do now? The common suggestion is to grind finer or use hotter water if sourness is undesirable, but drawdown is already too long and water can't really be hot enough. Are some beans destined to be ""espresso-only"" and/or prefer espresso over pourover? Another variable I'm curious about is to whether to use more water during bloom phase (Hoffmann recommends 2x but no more than 3x and Rao recommends 3x IIRC).",1609519812

Coffee,"I remember the exact moment I fell in love with coffee, and wanted to share it with you","That day is seared into my brain as a life changing moment that set me down the path toward one of my lifelong passions.

It was 8 years ago and I was studying for a final exam in college. I had already been drinking coffee for years but didn't particularly like the taste, I was the typical Starbucks drinker who used it as a pick me up. We had an automatic drip coffee maker in our house that we would fill with Folgers.

My sister had visited Costa Rica and brought me back a bag of coffee, and since it was a treat I thought it deserved to be brewed in something fancier than our Mr. Coffee. So I borrowed my roommate's V60 and gave it a try. The coffee was pre ground, I didn't have a scale, I have no idea how much coffee or water I used, at the time I didn't even know that type of thing mattered. I definitely didn't know about proper pour over technique or use a gooseneck kettle.

I sat down with my cup of coffee and continued to study. The first sip grabbed my attention immediately, I was tasting so many flavors and depth that I never knew existed in coffee. It was so amazing that I stopped studying and took the time to savor my cup, captured in a short moment of serenity.

Since then I've been making coffee using pour overs, french press, aeropress, siphon filters, and cold brew. I've roasted my own coffee and sought out roasters in every city I've visited since. And even though objectively I've drank better coffee almost every day since then, nothing has ever come close to the mind-opening cup I randomly made that day.",1609511311

Here’s what I did:

- 47 grams of coffee, and 700 grams of boiling water into a carafe.  Swirl or stir to make sure all the grounds are involved
- 4:00 steep time
- pour in batches through the V60 filter, making sure to keep the flow of the V60 going.  i.e. Don’t let it run to a stop before you’re finished.
- drawdown takes about 4:00

HINT: Swirl, or stir before each pour to make sure the grounds stay suspended.  At the beginning this is to keep all the grounds involved, and at the end it’s to get as much of the grounds into the filter as possible; it aids in cleanup.",1609508190

Coffee,Recommend manual espresso devices for traveling that can actually do high pressures?,"Besides the Wacaco Nanopresso, what other manual espresso machines are recommended for traveling? The problem with the Wacaco is that if the coffee is ground very fine the gasket in the filter head blows out. It fundamentally is not built for high pressures.

Almost all of them seem to be very dubious when they claim over 9 bar / 130 psi. The Cafflano Compressor for instance can be squeezed with your fingers, so there is *no way* that can achieve 130 *pounds* of forced over a square inch.

I'd like to add a V60 to my mix and I've already settled on size 2 but I need advice on materials. Glass or ceramic seem like they would be my first choice because of longevity and not leaching plastic into the cofee (after it gets old) but I've read that people complain about the glass ones being too brittle and the ceramic ones requiring extensive preheating or the temperature drop will be too much to make good coffee. 

Should I go for plastic? Glass? Ceramic? Metal? What have your experiences been like and what would you recommend?

Coffee,Why do finer grind and shorter brew time not cancel each other out?,"Maybe that's a stupid question in the title - so please forgive me - but it stems from a problem I've been having with my brew times in Aeropress for a long time.

So far I've been using a corse grinds that, due to its nature, requires longer brew. However, unlike other people for whom ""longer brew"" equals like a minute or two, I had to brew mine for 8 minutes in order to get a drinkable bewerage (14g to 215g ratio, medium roast, pre-heating included, boiling water).

With Aeropress and milk prep it took me something like 16 minutes and often I couldn't finish it within my break period at work.

So I thought, ""hey, \*\*if I grind finer, I'll be able to brew it quicker\*\* - I went down from medium fine to fine (10 clicks on C2 timemore) and brewed it for 5 minutes - noticeably sour.

Why don't these two cancel each other out and let me cut down on the brew time? How can I manage the one and a half minute time window sometimes advertised as being the Aeropress' strong suit? I have to fit it within a work break or I won't be able to finish it.",1609460529

They told the barista that it was for an espresso machine and was told it would be a ""fine grind"" instead of their standard drip coffee setting.

If not, will they regrind it? Or grind a new bag, anyone know?

Coffee,"Recommendations for ""automatic"" coffee makers","Hello, I would really appreciate this community's recommendations on a mostly automatic coffee maker that I can use with fresh beans and my existing grinder (so no pods). Both drip and espresso style machines work. I use a Chemex today and love it, but also want to add something slightly more automatic / push button to save time and effort. Budget is around $500 USD. 

Some of the options I've looked at: 

1. [Spinn Coffee Maker:](https://www.spinn.com/coffee-maker) Seems really nice but its still not shipped, and the availability isn't until sometime next year. 
2. [Technivorm Moccamaster](https://www.amazon.com/Technivorm-Moccamaster-Coffee-Maker-Ounce/dp/B08FRRP3YL?ref_=ast_sto_dp): This seems like the recommended choice for drip, but I can't tell if its just a glorified coffee maker or if it actually makes good coffee. 
3. [Delonghi Magnifica](https://www.delonghi.com/en-us/products/coffee-and-espresso/coffee-makers/automatic-coffee-makers/magnifica-esam-3300-0132213148): This seems mostly automatic, but again, not sure of reliability of machine / and quality of the coffee it makes. 
4. [Ninja Speciality Coffee Maker](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ninja-10-cup-specialty-coffee-maker-with-fold-away-frother-and-glass-carafe-cm401-black-stainless-steel/6346475.p?acampID=0&amp;cmp=RMX&amp;irclickid=zPDQslwIGxyLWiW0RHQK3XRkUkEyVlT0ExyDwg0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;loc=Narrativ&amp;mpid=376373&amp;ref=198&amp;skuId=6346475): Again, this seems like a basic drip, but not sure if this better or worse than the Moccamaster. 

Can you please recommend good options among the above, or something else completely?",1609456568

Coffee,Need help dialing in!,"Hello folks!  I'm trying to pull some shots of a new coffee bean and am having trouble with it.  I'll list my equipment and recipe below, but first, I want to mention that due to budget concerns, I'm not able to upgrade any of my equipment right now.  Thanks for reading this!  Here goes.

Beans: Ethiopian and Sumatra blend, medium-light roast.
Espresso Machine: Delonghi EC155 (with bottomless Pavoni basket)
Grinder: Oxo Conical Burr Grinder on finest setting.
Tamper: Delonghi weighted 51mm.
Recipe: 16 to 36 and 0:22 seconds.

I've probably pulled six shots so far and they have all been wildly acidic.  I've got my tamping technique down, I'm on the finest grind setting, and I've played a bit with temp surfing (although perhaps not very well).  The grind is extremely even and extremely fine.  The shots have pulled quickly and the pucks tend to be pretty dry but stay intact.  The crema has been a bit thinner but consistent.  The shots seem a bit thin but I can sense the boldness of the profile behind the acidity.

I understand that this probably sounds like under extraction, but I am grinding very finely, which doesn't seem to make sense.  If you have any thoughts on how to improve these shots, please let me know.  I have been drinking espresso for years but am very new to dialing in my own shots.

Coffee,Fairly specific/random question. Pls bear with me lol,"I love light, bright, fruity coffees as much as anyone. That's my preference. But sometimes I need a break. Light roasts can be finicky and annoying to both roast and brew, and I also love a developed, full-bodied offering from Sumatra or Yemen. I usually get really great, complex results with these more developed roasts in my french press or another immersion brewer.

Here's my problem. I'm a home roaster, but starting in January I won't have access to my roaster for five or so months. Most specialty places that I know of don't carry these types of more developed roasts. Not talking, like, traditional dark roast. You know, something just past second crack, full city-full city+, whatever you want to call it. Does anyone have recs for roasters in NYC that consistently have more developed options?

Coffee,"Jeju Samdasoo, the best water for most coffee?","Good day, fellow coffee enthusiasts,

I brew at home with a very lovely set up, the most recent addition being Samdasoo water, which is a miracle for most brews. I mainly do pour over with V60, Kalita Wave and Origami dripper.

Samdasoo has been absolutely magical with the majority of coffees, but every now and again there is a coffee that you can get a very nice immersion brew, whether it's with tap water or Samdasoo, but for one reason or another, pour overs just fail to pull enough from them. Anyone else experience this?

I work in an espresso bar, and I brewed the same coffee there with our filtered tap water and it was pretty good. But no matter what I do at home (used an EK at work and have a Kinu m47 at home) it seems to taste awfully similar. I've made the grind immensely finer, so much so it added a minute to the brew time, tried our tap filtered vs samdasoo and it pretty much tastes the same with slight differences. Tried dosing up also. Absolute madness.

Any tips or similar experiences or whatever? Can't get my head around this one. Maybe need specific water for other brews?

Coffee,What do you recommend next (brew methods/equipment)?,"Hi r/coffee! Over the past 2-3 months this sub has fueled my interest in specialty coffee. From a long time drip and occasional press user with a Krups blade grinder, I've upgraded to a Baratza Encore and added and Aeropress and Chemex (christmas present) to my repitoire. I've brewed 3 times with the Chemex using the Hoffman method and have gotten great results (amazing clarity, 4:30-5:30 draw downs). Never tasted coffee with so much clarity before and definitely see it as one of my go to brew methods. It's just so satisfying to make pour overs and SO pumped about retrying some darker roasts using this method (as I typically don't enjoy dark roasts via drip or press). 

I will definitely be using all 4 methods depending on my mood/end goal but with someone 2-3 months in with the following equipment what would the community recommend I add, if any. I wasn't trying to get one of everything but it seems like I'm on that path, I'm more interested in blending convenience (drip machine) with a variety of methods to maximize the experience and taste of any coffee I buy. And I know that takes time and experimentation and so many other variables, but really looking for input from the r/coffee High Council as to if anything is obviously missing or if adding X would really round out my options/experience. My first thought is a standard pour over rig (V60 or Wave) is missing. Not ready for venturing into espresso machines.

Coffee,lesson learned: don't ignore certain beans because of their tasting notes,"I have been making third wave coffee for more than a year now, at home, using a moccamaster or a clever dripper. I kept snobbing non fruity coffees because of the ""they won't be as good as light roasts"" lies i kept telling myself. Today was a different day because the absolute freshest batch available at my roaster was an indonesian coffee with notes of tobaco, amber honey and a  creamy finish. i bought them because the batch was less than 10 days old, so at its peak of flavors compared to the light roasts that were roasted 3 weeks ago.

Turns out i made some of the best coffee i ever had in months! Not only was it much more easy to dial in (light roasts are a pain to dial in, i'm sure folks know that) but the final cup was soooo delicious! It really had a strong taste of amber honey and tobaco, it's just a fantastic coffee all around and i bet it will translate really well in a clever dripper as well!

Coffee,Almost a 50-50 chance espresso gets pulled very slowly on Breville Barista Pro,"I changed my grinder settings to grind finer little while back. It works well with the coffees I get from work usually, given that Starbucks' coffees are older and staler. I recently bought coffee from a good local speciality roaster and now notice that about half my shots pull perfectly (within the espresso range), whereas the other half is so slow to pull that it's better discarded. I've wasted around 50 grams already.

One observation I have made is that if I tamp much lighter than usual, it's likelier for the espresso to pull properly. By a light tamp I mean applying enough force to level the surface, as opposed to a proper tamp.

I think I know what I'm doing wrong but I wanted to ask on this subreddit before I make changes that could waste even more of my precious coffee. 

1. Grind coarser. 
2. Grind less coffee. (17g, instead of 18g.)

Doing so would still likely allow the liqueur pulled fall within the espresso range, if only just. Is there anything else I should look into?",1609439037
Coffee,Can different coffee brewers dramatically change the flavors across the same origin and roast?,"I commonly purchase a light roast from a local coffee shop that I have brewed in my AeroPress for a few years, and love it. However, this past holiday season, I received a Hario v60 01. Brewing this same roast in the v60 is ... ""off"". It just doesn't taste good. I've brewed other beans and roasts in my v60, with consistent success, but this specific origin I just can't get to taste good, even though in my AeroPress, it's phenomenal. I've adjusted grind size, water-to-coffee ratio, and various brew methods, all failing to produce a good cup.

My AeroPress recipe is:

* Inverted
* Prewet filter, preheated mug
* 18 grams coffee, ground medium-fine (14 on my Baratza Encore)
* 250 milliliters water boiling
* 50 milliliters water for 30 second bloom
* The rest of the water added and steeped for 60 seconds
* Flip, then press for 45 seconds

My v60 recipe is:

* 4:6 method by Tetsu Kasuya
* Prewet filter, preheated mug
* 15 grams coffee, ground medium-course (25 on my Baratza Encore)
* 250 milliliters water boiling
* 1st pulse: 30 milliliters
* 2nd pulse: 70 milliliters
* 3rd - 5th pulses: 50 milliliters each
* Draw down finishes very close to 3:40, give or take
* Flat bed, no mud or sludge

I've also tried Scott Rao's method and James Hoffman's ultimate v60 technique, both with similar results. Tastes great with the AeroPress, is horrible with the v60, specifically as I approach the end of the cup, even though it's 100% clean with no fines (as it should be paper-filtered). Also, with other beans of varying roast levels, the v60 produces an amazing cup with the recipe above. *It's just this very specific bag of beans*.

Is that odd, or is it common that different coffee brewers can drastically bring out different tastes in the same set of beans?",1609438103

tea,Why does my green tea not taste as good as when I first started brewing it?,"Over the summer I started getting more into tea. I bought 100g of a South Indian White Havukal from TeaGschwendner, and it was absolutely divine. I had drunken mostly black coffee and some english breakfasts I had no clue how to make, and my first real cup of a more delicate tea was just great. Months later, this tea now tastes just more uniform and doesn't evoke the same emotions within me. I've stopped drinking coffee altogether and I've noticed I can taste much more in my other teas, but this one just feels flat now. Even if I prepare it in the exact same way (which isn't how I prefer it anymore) it just isn't the same. Could it be that maybe it's because I'm closer to the bottom of the bag and there are more stems and twigs? Or just that my palate has refined some and this isn't nearly as nuanced as I originally thought? It's still good, and when I eyeball the amount of leaves (usually adding a bit more than recommended) it has a lot more of a richer quality and is much smoother, I just can't get it as good as how it once was. Is this normal? I don't have a lot of teas so could it just be overconsumption of this one tea?",1608202483

I made sure to warm the pot up a bit before pouring the hot water in it and after two uses it's started crazing on the outside at the very least, I think the inside is too but it's hard to see. It seems some kind of mineral is leaching from the cracks making the salt smell?  This is teapot still safe to use? I've heard crazing is normal, but I've never heard of leaching salt smelling minerals.

tea,"To the best of my knowledge, tobacco is not, nor has ever been, used as a tea. Why?","I'm definitely not here to debate personal feelings towards tobacco.  But here me out:

Tea, or ""infusions"" in general, have been a thing for literally thousands of years.  More plants than I can count (in addition to tea itself) are used as an infusion throughout all kinds of different cultures.

Similarly, tobacco has been used for at least hundreds (maybe thousands?) of years by many different cultures, in many different forms--pipes, cigars, nasal snuff, Swedish snus, American dip, etc.

How have the two never crossed?  We've been infusing all kinds of plants into hot water for thousands of years, and using tobacco in many different formats for almost as long.  Is there something inherent to tobacco which would make it unsuitable as an infusion?  Obviously just steeping some pipe tobacco or snus or whatever in hot water would be disgusting, but then again smoking snus or putting cigarette tobacco in your mouth would be equally gross--point being, tobacco is cultivated and cured for specific purposes.

Coffee,French Press overhyped or am I spoiled by other methods,"I often see French press as one of the more recommended brew methods for people looking to up there coffee game. Heck, I've even recommended it to friends as well. 

Through the year I, like many, have gotten deeper into the coffee world upgrading equipment and trying new methods. French Press, Aero Press, Clever Dripper, and V60. I've taken time to experiment and test each method dialing them in to what tastes good to me. Yes, I've seen every James Hoffman technique and others too. I have a Timemore C2 grinder and I'm very pleased with it, so grinder quality isn't of concern really. 

Through all my coffee drinking and testing, I am ultimately underwhelmed by the French Press.

What I'm not impressed with:
[Yes, I know there are ways to mitigate the below]
Long brew times
Silty coffee
Longer clean up times 
Less flavorful cups, not as vibrant. 

The other methods I use have filters so fair to say filter coffee is for me.  

V60: like many is my favorite cup time after time. As I have refined my method my cups have elevated to the next level. It is finicky and a more technical brew method. Goose neck kettle and grinder(!) elevate this. Cheap entry for a plastic V60 but basically requires other equipment to get the most out of it. 

Clever Dripper: an easy method I have only recently gotten into. Not quite as vibrant as a V60 but still pulls flavor the French Press doesn't. Easy. I haven't used a lower quality grinder with it, but I imagine it's forgiving. 

Aero Press: an underdog in my book. Not my favorite process with more pieces to fiddle with and clean keeping it from being my favorite method. But I really like the cup it produces, had a period I had to use a blade grinder with it and it still made great clean cups. Several methods can be used so you can keep exploring. Doesn't need a fancy kettle.

These are my opinions, so don't take it as gospel. But I'm reluctant to brew with the French Press now. If I were to recommend a method for someone looking to up their game I would easily say start with the Aero Press.",1609434086

Coffee,Earwaxy taste on light roasted beans.,"My coffee journey has been slow and painful to my tastebuds. I thought I had a pour over recipe down that was at least palatable, but I switched from medium-dark roasted beans to light roasted (home roasted) and it's coming out terrible. The coffee tastes like earwax. I think this is what people refer to as ""sour"" but am not sure. I have the baratza encore and am grinding around 15-16. My water is as hot as it can be. I'm doing a \~16.6:1 water:coffee ratio. I rinse my filters and bloom at around 2.5-3:1 water:coffee for 45 seconds. Then I try to pour \~60-70g every 30 seconds, for a total of \~500g in 3 minutes. It takes \~1 more minute for the water to go through, leading to a \~4 minute total extraction time (not counting the bloom).

I have also tried brewing these beans in a french press. Grinding at 25 on the encore, and using \~15:1 water:coffee. I get the same sour taste, though a little less strong.

I tried cupping the coffee and the earwaxy taste was there, but not as strong. So whatever was wrong with my roast/beans, my brewing seems to be making it worse. 

I have been frustrated for months and am close to giving up on home roasted/brewed coffee. No matter what I do, it never comes out better than mediocre. Even with dark roasted beans or beans I buy from a specialty roaster, it's always either sour, bitter, astringent, chewy or some awful combination of the four.

My questions are, are light roasts supposed to taste sour? And what can I do to make it taste better?",1609433437

Coffee,Looking for a good pour over scale,"I recently got a Hario V60 and a Gooseneck Kettle (stovetop) and I’m realizing my food scale is not up to the task. 

It’s a cheaper one and it has an auto time off regardless of whether the weight is actively increasing or not, and it tares when you turn it on, so it basically doesn’t work for a pour over at all.

Coffee,Have French press and blade grinder. Coffee sucks. Should I dump the press or the grinder?,"I’m struggling to make a decent cup of coffee. I have a source of great beans (Small World Coffee in Princeton NJ), but limited equipment (I’m living here only for 6 months). 

I started with the drip machine that came with my flat, and pre-ground beans. Coffee tasted great for the first few days until the grounds got stale, then it tasted worse and worse. Also the crappy drip machine wasted a ton of coffee - lots of it was still dry when the brew finished. 

So, got a cheap blade grinder. Now the coffee is fresher since I can use whole beans, but the wastage is still and issue. 

So, got a French press. But now I’m drinking bitter sludge. Tried using the Hoffman technique to reduce the sludge but I think the blade grinder just creates too many fines for it to really work well. Even tried doing the sieve thing and multiple grinds, which is super tedious. And still, the coffee is powdery tasting. 

So... what next? Should I keep the blade grinder and change the brewing method? Or keep using the French press but get a fancy hand grinder?

I just want a cup of nice coffee.",1609430690

Coffee,Bitterness with a coarse grind?,"Hi everyone,

My v60 brews haven't been very good lately  and I'm failing to understand why. I've been getting more bitterness than normal in my coffees, with various beans, which make me believe it is not bean related. I get a bitter aftertaste, around the middle/back of the tongue. Barely any sweetness.

I normally brew 15gr to 250ml. I use a Comandante grinder and have been going as fine as 16 clicks and as coarse as 30 clicks. Even with the coarser settings, I still get bitterness, even though at the same time it feels a bit wattery and body-less. I've been brewing with 92-95C water with a Fellow EKG, wondering if I'm agitating too much, or maybe my grinder is not working very well. For water, I filter the tap water in my city (very good quality water - Madrid), using a Brita filter. Have also tried bottled. 

Currently brewing the Christmas Coffee by The Barn (a washed Colombian).

Any thoughts or tips? I'm getting quite disappointed with my brews and every cup is just more frustration...

Coffee,First time on Aeropress...may be the best coffee I've made...and I forgot my scale.,"So I'm on vacation, got an Aeropress for Christmas. Figured I'd take it with me and give it a go. I watched a lot of videos, looked at the championship recipes, looked at Reddit posts. Feel like I have a basic grasp of what's going on. 


So here I am in a cabin away from civilization, intermittent wifi (will this post even work?), closest store is an hour away. And I realize...I left my scale at home. Ehh...


Well, still gotta try, right? I know roughly where the beans fill for 18g on my Timemore G1, so I do a bit more, around 30g I think. Coarse grind. I use 2 filters...I really don't like sediment in my coffee. Inverted method. Plunger at the 4, pour in coffee, pour water to near the top, stir with VIGOR (that might be a joke only for me), forget what to do next which is nice because it let the coffee brew, remember what to do and put the filter on, put on cup and press! I will say, it was not is resistive as I thought it'd be, so I slowed down a bit. Only filled up my cup a third of the way, so I poured some water in it to about half...maybe a tad more. Let it sit for 10 minutes. 


Amazing!! Seriously, probably the best coffee I've made! I expected mediocre or plain or dull. But this was bright, not sour, not weak. Truly exceeded any expectation I had for this seemingly simple device.

Coffee,Delonghi Magnifica ESAM 3300 slowly leaking water,"Hello r/coffee! I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction so I can get back up and running with delicious americanos in the morning.

I have a battle tested Delonghi Magnifica ESAM 3300 that recently started leaking water onto the counter. After a few days there is a visible lake.

I use it around 4 times a day on average, clean the machine weekly on Sundays, descale within a week or so of getting the notification, etc. The last time I did a deep cleaning, I took the side panel off to see where the water could be leaking from since it didn't seem to be the obvious location of the water tank gasket. After one brew there was visible water behind the brew group and in the water tank area.

Unfortunately, I opened up a support ticket and got an immediate replay that I was on my own because I took the panel off and voided the warranty. I've poked around a bit since but don't see anything obvious. Would appreciate any help or insight into what might be a possible cause.

I'm kinda new to coffee and I was considering buying one of the two products in the title. I already own an aeropress and a frenchpress but I just discovered V60 coffee and thought It was great.

My problem is this : I rarely brew more than 10-12 g of coffee at once so the V60 01 would be more appropriate but I'm also really interested in the immersion method that the switch offers. 

I think that you can use the switch as a V60 as well (correct me If i'm wrong) but I'm concerned about the size. Is It too big for my usual brew since It's a V60 02 on It or It doesn't really change much in the end ?

Coffee,Amateur trying to get to next level,"I love coffee, it's the highlight of my morning. 
I've been using good beans from reasonable places, so I know when I get amazing lightly roasted beans, with a little chaff and that yummy savoury smell.


I had been using an Aeropress and a fake-burr shitty grinder.
I moved to a new Baratza Encore and the grind quality/consistency (just looking at the puck) is soooo much better. Good value for money really.


So now that I have reasonable ground coffee from good beans, I'm trying to be a little more scientific with my aeropress approach.

I looked at the world championship recipes, but they are a little out there for me at this point (highly coarse grind, refractometers, re-mineralising the water, etc).


So I've gotten to the point I feel I have a good recipe and wanted to sanity check it with the folks here:

1) I pre-wet and rinse the filter and aeropress, warm cups etc.
2) I grind using the Encore at about a 12, makes nice fluffy, consistent ground coffee. This is also inline with their recommendation on their docs.
3) I use about 16g of coffee, and initially add about 50g of water, leave for 25/30 seconds and agitate.
4) I add the rest of the water to the top of the aeropress (around 220g). &lt;- Is this the ""steep"" phase?
5) After one more minute or so, I press slowly (I used to press fast and firm, but a lot of YouTube tells me slow), it takes about 30 seconds to press, but I find it works well.

So that's it, overall about 2 mins, 30 second press, 1.5 min steep.

Any tips, anything stupid you guys see here?

p.s. I guess I'm asking because I didn't know it was a good idea to press slowly a few days ago, and I'm using aeropress for about 3 years. Just looking for any other stupid things I'm doing.


I see lots of recipes suggest V60 style coarseness for aeropress but doesn't make sense to me unless the steep time is 3min+.",1609409567
Coffee,My experience brewing/tasting Indonesian Kopi Luwak for the first time!,"My girlfriends dad and I share a love of fine coffee and he bought me a (humanely-sourced) 100g bag of Kopi Luwak for Christmas. I nearly cried when I opened it lol. I never thought I’d try it in my life. 

(Skip this paragraph if you know what it is) For those who don’t know, this coffee is quite common in Indonesia/Vietnam, but in most other parts of the world, it’s regarded as one of the rarest (and most expensive) coffees there is. Wild civet cats (a ferret-like jungle dweller) love to eat coffee cherries; they are very picky and seek out only the finest/ripest cherries to eat. The beans get digested and somewhat fermented in the process, then of course, the cats leave their “droppings”. Farmers gather them, wash them, sort them, and finally, roast them. Kinda disgusting, right? 

You’d think this would result in some amazingly complex coffee. However, I was surprised to find it has only 1-2 notes of rich dark chocolate and raspberry (the overall taste depends on harvest season, I assume this was harvested in late summer/fall, I don’t know for sure). Although underwhelming in complexity, it is EXTREMELY smooth, rich, and leaves very little bitter after-taste. By the way, this is by far the lightest roast I’ve ever brewed. Getting notes of dark chocolate out of a such a light roast was weird. For those curious, I brewed 23g at a 14.5 water/coffee ratio, 203-204 water temp, using a chemex with a natural filter. Total brew time was 3:45. 

Not in the class of geishas and the like, but it’s not supposed to be. Quite the unique experience and I do plan to brew the rest of the bag. A simple, yet very enjoyable coffee overall.",1609407086

Coffee,"New to the world of actually decent coffee, looking for suggestions","TLDR: Switched from pre-ground dark roast to whole bean light roast (completely random choice) and fell in love. Not sure where to go from here. Currently buying from Christopher Bean Coffee and a brand on Amazon called The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf LLC, and am looking for other suggestions within the same price range ($8-$13 per 12oz bag, ideally on the lower end). I hate smoky and chocolate flavors, and love sweet, fruity flavors, so anything along those lines are very welcome.  


To preface, I used to think I hated coffee. I would never drink it without milk, sugar, and flavoring syrup. No matter what brand of coffee I bought, I could never stomach it without them. I tried French Press and drip brewing thinking that would help but no dice. Then I was gifted a spice grinder (I know blade grinders are a no-no, but it was a gift and I'm poor so I can't upgrade yet) and decided to buy some cheap whole bean coffee to test it out with, and this light roast Peruvian coffee was the cheapest so I went with that despite only having ever drank dark roast my entire life.   


The difference was immediate. I can hardly smell anything even if it's in front of my nose, but the aroma of the beans was amazing. I didn't add any milk or syrup, and added less sugar than usual and I was literally chugging the cup it was that good. I don't know if it was because it was freshly ground beans that did it or if it was the lighter roast, or even the location (I think I've only had Brazilian and Columbian coffee before) but this was the first time in my entire life I've ever enjoyed a cup of actual coffee. I woke up today actually excited to drink more coffee instead of reluctantly sipping on it to get me through the day, it's like a whole new world opened up. And the wild part is, this happened with some cheap, $9/lb beans, a cheap blade grinder, and simple drip method. I know I'll fall in love with coffee even more once I upgraded my beans and brewing since the burr grinders are too expensive right now and I can't justify buying one when I already have a grinder. So I'm focusing on the beans right now and filter my water by boiling since I don't trust the filter the fridge has. I also still have my French Press and plan on doing that again too once I figure out where the heck I put it.",1609393766

So I decided to try a combo of the two and see what happened. The results were fantastic!

I use 32 grams of coffee for 500 grams of water. I did my usual bloom pour at 60 grams, swirled the coffee, and let it sit for 45 seconds. I poured to 200 grams and let it drain similar to the 4:6 200 grams is 40% of 500. Once the bed settled I poured the remaining 300 grams of water and let it draw down. Total time 3:46 and this yielded me an amazing cup of coffee that had a nice sweetness and an incredibly clean finish. The coffee was a light roasted higher elevation Guatamala. I got a nice cocoa sweetness with some lemon in the cup and a very crisp finish. It might not be new but this hybrid is new to me.",1609372341

Coffee,Considering moving on from nespresso - confused and seeking guidance,"Hey folks,  

I grew up on dunkin donuts and nyc $1 blue coffee cups, but after spending a few years overseas, i can no longer drink drip coffee. I now love double shot espressos and the occasional flat white. 

I recently tried to ween off a $80 a month nespresso habit b/c 1) i have heard that the real coffee bean experience is far better and 2) if i can get a better experience at a better price, its win-win

A couple of weeks i ago, i bought a few moka pots and picked up some cafe bustelo from costco - and while it was a nice experiment, the whole act of slowly boiling water and the lack of crema and 'watery' experience took me right back to nespresso,  
  
I drink coffee twice a day and spending 10 minutes a clip just wasn't doing it for me.
  
Should I invest into something like a Breville® Barista Pro? If so, how much 'better' would a $700 coffee maker (without beans) make espresso than the nespresso machine? How long will it take me to learn how to 'dial in' a proper dose? Do i need to spend more money on a separate grinder? 

Is there a best path forward here?",1609365161

Coffee,Any coffee roasters recommendations in the UK?,"So most of my coffee life I have solely been drinking Starbucks and honestly I really like the taste. About a year ago now I became a barista at a small coffee shop and it has really made me a fan of more artisan coffee and not just liking the Starbucks syrups. It lead to buying my own espresso machine over lockdown and I absolutely love it but I have had trouble finding some good beans. I started out with a company called RAVE and tried a few of their blends. It was nice enough, but nothing too mind blowing for me. I stuck with it for a while until I found myself short on coffee and picked up a bad from Starbucks while I was there with a friend.

I've been drinking it for about a week now and I much prefer it to the other coffee I had. I don't know if this is just because it's what I'm used to or I just prefer that kind of flavour. I would just use the coffee we have at work because I like that but it's a really big company and I kinda want to support small businesses at the moment with everything that is going on.

Coffee,Wacaco Nanopresso: Best practices?,"I got the Wacaco NanoPresso for Christmas. I am aware that this is not a professional/high end espresso maker. But it surprised me a lot. The espresso quality feels better and more consistent than Nespresso and while the quality does not reach Barrista quality it comes close. In my opinion, fully worth it.

Anyone own's this piece as well and wants to share some best practices? In particular I am curious:

1. How much water to use exactly? I know an espresso is 1oz of water but how much best to put into the tank? Ideally I could then pump until the end for reproducability
2. What is the best ground size? I have a simple automatic coffee grinder? How do I best gauge the right size?
3. For reproducability I'd like to count the number of pumps. The manual states ""One pump per second"" and ""it takes about 35 seconds to create the espresso"". This suggests \~30 pumps. But this is way too much. I feel somewhere around 15-20 would be appropriate?
4. The manual states to pump *slowly*. But what does that mean? Shall I push the pump and then wait such that I do \~1 pump/sec? Or should the *pushing action itself* be \~1sec?

&amp;#x200B;

What is your experience in preheating the device by just pumping water first? I don't feel too much difference and the downside is that the boiling water cools down meanwhile.

Also, in your experience, how critical is boiling water as opposed to medium/hot water? The latter would be useful to take on a trip with a thermos but it won't be boiling then but just hot...",1609360845

Coffee,Best burr grinder on Amazon 2021?,"Hello /r/Coffee,

I have been grinding my coffee beans using this [blade grinder](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-BCG211OB-Blade-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B00CT9XZMA/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kitchenaid+grinder&amp;qid=1609358585&amp;sr=8-8) which has tremendously inconsistent grind sizes (huge chunks exist while some is dust). Obviously this isn't ideal, but I am not sure how important this is since I French Press my coffee anyway, and apparently grind consistency is less important then?

If so, I'd really like to get a Burr grinder, possibly like the [Fellow Ode (reviewed by James Hoffman)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE4NT8MY-Zo&amp;t=1s&amp;ab_channel=JamesHoffmann). Though this doesn't seem to exist on Amazon and I'd like to buy from there since I have a stockpile of Amazon giftcards from holidays.

Can I get a very good Burr grinder like the Ode on Amazon? Having a small grind size option isn't too important since with French press I guess you leave them quite larger, but I'd really like to get grind consistency finally.

Coffee,"Pour over - minimize caffeine, maximize taste","Hi, this is my first post in this sub.  
I love coffee but I am extremely sensitive to caffeine and also metabolizes it very slowly.  
Pour over is my favorite method, but one cup is often too much for me.  
I also have a Gaggia classic espresso machine that I love, and I can tolerate about 1 espresso shot per day (in the morning).  
However, I do want to drink pour over too as light roasts are by far my favorites, and also the most caffeinated :(  


As I understand it, towards the end of the pour over a lot of caffeine is still being released while the 'taste' gradually gets watered down - sorry if I'm over simplifying here.  
This is why instead of reducing the amount of ground coffee, I'm often pouring half the liquid and then reluctantly 'water it down' (gasp!)  


Things I don't have: a kettle with thermometer. I kinda eye-ball the temperature each time. I think caffeine release is also influenced by temperature.

This was my first dan cong ever. I expected some beautiful and intense fragrance but it's just bad. I had the highest expectations for this tea as it is **$1.11/g** \- used 6g in this 100ml gaiwan = $6.66 which is really expensive, nowhere near the other expensive tea I've got in the last 4 orders. I've got Mi Lan Xiang Dan Cong from What-Cha for $0.33/g and I haven't tried it yet, but it's more than 3 times cheaper and I bet, I hope that it will be better than this. This is the worst oolong I've ever tried while expecting to be the best. Did they mess up the packaging and gave me something else? It's from March 2020, the leaves are extremely dry and light and don't have any smell while dry and almost nothing while wet. It's also bitter, but the tea has almost no smell at all. I'm very confused. For some reason it got more fragrant at the 3rd infusion and the fragrance went away again at the 5th infusion. I used 99C hot water, 10 infusions 6g from the tea in 100ml gaiwan. Probably brewing it wrong, but I followed their instructions. I mean... it's not a bad tea... nevermind, it is. It's incredibly dry and slightly bitter and it has some vague floral notes, but it's very flat or I'm just bad at tasting and expected too much from it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry for the rant, I'm just confused. Can you explain what does ""dan cong"" actually mean? Is it just leaves from older trees in the Guangdong area? I bet it is not really from a single tree, but probably just older one? If it's from older trees, then it is normal to be more bitter and astringent I guess. I'm probably just dumb and very uneducated and don't know what to expect from a dan cong. Sorry. Can you recommend me good online vendors for dan cong? I want to explore more dan congs, aged whites and aged raw pu'erhs in 2021. This is my tea goal for 2021",1608030639

So much purer in fact that I actually had to use more tea then I have before to be satisfied because it felt like it was so pure it was weak. Of course it is possible that me feeling like the tea was too weak is my own taste changing. But the water is far purer then other kettles I've had. It stays hot longer because of the insulation, even if you don't use the keep warm setting the kettle itself can keep it warm just by insulation. when not pressing the button to poor water its water tight. It heats up pretty quietly, and beeps pretty quitely as well. It is a little bit heavy because of the insulation but I don't think its unreasonably so. In real life it looks black unless you have the light hit it right, then you can tell that its actually a dark purple. It looks really good. It does have a bit of a short cord, but usually that shouldn't be much of an issue as places you'd usually place it shouldn't be that far from a outlet, its a bit over 2 feet of cord, which it has a spot on the underneath of the heating plate to wind it back up in. It has a button labeled rapid boil, if you ever just need some boiling water (assumably for something other then tea). it also seems to remember the last temp you used, for example I use 195 f for my black tea, I just press the + button and it immediately sets itself up to that temperature. 

If you're looking for a new good looking and well functioning kettle I suggest this one.",1607988259

[What-Cha order](https://preview.redd.it/k6gov6mca6561.jpg?width=2811&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1adcec422ef72abc5d58d4f550aa0b1225a222a)

This was my first tea order in my life after someone here suggested me What-Cha 6 weeks ago. Meanwhile I ordered twice from MeiLeaf and once from Taiwanese Tea Crafts (after I fell in love with the Taiwanese ones I tried from MeiLeaf). What a journey! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my \*very strange\* experience - I feel like sharing what happened with you. It has happy ending :)

 Three people here told me that What-Cha orders arrive in a week and I was so sad that nobody contacts me from the local postal services. I received my other orders via DHL and UPS but with my last MeiLeaf order (free shipment from the Black Friday) arrived in the local post office and they put a message in my post box (what's the word in English? it's not my native language). It was soggy and almost ripped in parts almost disintegrated - I dried it and went with it to the local post office and... The lady there told me that I have a package for half of month sitting there and that it's scheduled for ""destroying"" in 5 days - my What-Cha package for over $100 that I was waiting for 34 days. But I knew that our local postal services are terrible and they don't even call us instead they come to the address, put a message somewhere instead of delivering directly the package. Anyway, I will know next time to visit the post office every 5 days, lol (I live near it, but I work from home and I became so lazy that I don't want to move my butt 100m away from home and imagine how lazy they are to destroy something that they can come and ring to my doorbell 100m away from them). End of story. Happy ending :)

This is my first Chinese tea ever. Embarrasing I know. I quickly fell in love in the last 30 days with the Taiwanese blacks and oolongs because they are so gentle, not bitter, not astringent and incredibly fragrant, so I almost thought that the Chinese would be ""worse"". Oh no no no. Big mistake, stooooopid brain of mine. This is absolutely amazing. Yes, it's very very very strong. It's also a little bitter but not astringent. And since I started using a gaiwan (stopped calling it gong fu, because someone called me out here that I should not call it gong fu brewing) and quit the sugar and almond milk (30 days ago) I knew that I couldn't drink any bitter teas without sugar. Again huge mistake. This is not too bitter, not like Indian teas, it's very gentle bitterness and it went away after the 5th infusion. I immediately thought about 60% chocolate, it's the most chocolatey tea I've tried. And it's not some vague note that I ""feel"" like trying to distinguish notes in other teas - it's clearly chocolate. You can't think of anything else. If I didn't know that it's a black tea, I would've guessed that this is a cacao shells infusion - the bitterness is exactly like a 60-65% darker but not very dark chocolate and the smell is exactly like cacao. It's perfect for cold winter mornings. Definitely the best black tea I've ever tried. I said the same tea a week ago about the Taiwanese Shanlinxi Qing Xin Black from Taiwanese Tea Crafts, but this Yunnan is bolder, stronger with simple but delicious smell and the slight bitterness wakes me up even faster, lol. I'd drink this as an everyday tea instead of the Shanlinxi - which is also incredible, but too gentle for early mornings.

&amp;#x200B;

What-Cha totally lived up to my high expectations and it deserves all the praise it receives and even more. Free/cheap shipping, high quality tea, wholesome note and 3 free samples O\_O and the packaging is great - I feel like I can leave it in the aluminum ziploc bags and it won't go flat any time soon.",1607964043

[Premium Darjeeling tea Second Flush](https://lelow.online/product/buy-giddahapahar-darjeeling-tea-online-india/)

Tea, the most well-liked beverage consumed by two-thirds of the world’s inhabitants is comprised of the processed leaf of Camellia sinensis. Tea sorts, primarily based on processing or harvested leaf growth are black (fermented), inexperienced (non-fermented) and oolong (semi-fermented). These main tea sorts differ in how tea is produced and processed in keeping with the totally different processes of drying and fermentation that decide its chemical composition. Inexperienced tea is produced through the use of younger tea leaves and offered for consumption without fermentation after withering, steaming or pan firing, drying and grading.

Black tea incorporates primarily thearubigins, theaflavins, flavonols and catechins. The overall polyphenol content material of inexperienced and black teas is analogous, however with several types of flavonoids current as a result of the diploma of oxidation throughout the processing

CONCLUSION

Tea is probably the most broadly consumed beverage on the earth, subsequent solely to water. There may be usually a false impression, primarily an advertising and marketing gimmick, that natural tea can be tea. Nonetheless, natural tea shouldn’t be comprised of the plant Camellia sinensis.

tea,Tea Drunk?,"Ik this is probably something that is asked alot about on here but i thought id see what the community thinks....

So i started drinking tea a couple days ago, and ive been watching mei leaf on youtube... he talked about being ""ea drunk"" in one of his video's, and said its a nice feeling and you get the best effects from the tea when you brew white, oolong, or green tea that has been aged gong-fu style, and that's the style i brew....

So i ordered and 8 year old aged white tea (quoted from source) "" cultivated in the 800 meters‘ mountain on Fujian province "" from china, and just some 2 year old jasmine tea....

So the first time i attempted to get tea drunk, i probably brewed about 5 grams maybe not even from these jasmine leave's and i drank 30+ cups (35ml gong fu tasting cups) and i felt alright... not really any different as om how he explained the effects to be, but i diddnt brew enough tea which makes sense... i just had a caffeine rush and felt genuinely good... Then after that i decided lets wait before i attempt this again, mainly because i diddnt want to feel like i was ""abusing the tea"" if there is such thing lol (i realize that sounds ridiculous, but now that i have felt a good ""tea drunk"" effect i understand it)

Now yesterday was interesting... i diddnt intend to get tea drunk but i just kind of did, and it was definitely an interesting experience and it was a stronger effect then i expected.... Basically i just really like tea, so since hte hour i woke up, til the hour when i went to bed, i diddnt stop drinking tea, other than when i went to the store to buy some tea lmao, but at night, when i finished probably my third or fourth liter (im not joking lol, i diddnt realize til i sat down and thought about how much i drank) of an aged white tea (with the odd pot of an 8 year old pu'ehr grown from the highest elevated tea treas in Taiwan and some milk oolong tea) i was just like damn.. things are kinda getting weird lol... 

i was super energetic probably from the caffeine but also very relaxed at the same time, and i couldn't really focus... i would get stuck on one thought that i couldn't stop thinking about (which is the same effect id get from smoking too much weed) or id just have no train of thought at all... id just feel as if the only thing's my brain could processes was what i was seeing but i also wasnt really impaired either despite this weird kind of psychedelic and subtle manic effect... and then as it started to die down a bit i just felt good... a little anxious but not really depressed lol, once it all finally weared off i had some shakes, i was very tired but in a relaxed sort of way and again pretty good...

So yeah that was my first experience from getting ""tea drunk"" and i was not expecting that at all, and i promise everything i felt was not placebo it was all genuine and i did not expect it at ALL to be so intense yet somehow subtle but i also cant wrap my head around how i diddnt really feel impaired at all at its peaks...

Anyone else ever get some insane effects off of tea? Id also like to point out that if your not brewing gong-fu or your not drinking aged tea (Preferably lighter teas) you may not have experienced this sort of effect if you were attempting to.. just throwing that out there because i read comments on other posts of people talking about how ""tea drunkenness"" is a myth and how they were never able to get this effect... Anyway what do you think and what were some of your experiences? PEACE!",1607907137

My pu'er is my go-to whenever I need a pick-me-up, and my gaiwan is outstanding for when I brew my anji white tea and my green teas, so it isn't really an issue with either on their own, just an issue with them together. I usually brew my pu'er Western style and get everything from it. The richness, the depth, the earthiness, the slight sweetness, and I can even get 2-3 infusions out of it (usually just 2). But whenever I try to brew it in my gaiwan it somehow comes out both bitter and tasteless.

When I brew Western style I use 3 grams tea per 8 oz water (212 Fahrenheit), and steep 4-5 minutes. With my gaiwan, I use 3 grams per 4 oz of water (tried at both 212 degrees and180 degrees) and brew for 1-2 minutes, and add 30 seconds to a minute with each infusion, but it gets more and more bitter after each pour. If I try brewing it for a shorter time it comes out tasteless, but if I brew it longer it gets undrinkably bitter. I've also tried 4 grams of tea at a shorter brewing interval to see if it helped but no dice. Both styles I make sure to rinse the tea first. I know I'm messing up somewhere but I absolutely cannot figure out what I'm doing wrong.",1607885395

I have adjusted the internal burr setting to 4 (it was at a default of 6) and have been trying shots between the range of 6 and 2 on the external grind setting. I've also been weighing my shots and have been getting anywhere from a 1:2 to 1:5 ratio...it's all over the place. 

Where my doubts lie:

1. Tamping pressure - I try to tamp with equal pressure every time, but it's hard for me to tell. Is a calibrated tamper worth it? 
2. Grind setting - it's been pretty difficult getting a good grind setting. There's a huge difference even with changing the grind by 1 step -- choking the machine vs shots running too fast.
3. Pressure gauge - do I need to pay attention to this? I've read conflicting things on a lot of reddit threads on whether the pressure gauge gives useful information or not. 
4. Automatic vs manual mode - will controlling the ratio using manual mode make a big difference? I have tried it but can't tell because all my shots taste equally terrible... 
5. General doubt and confusion - sometimes I can't even tell if it's sour or bitter?

This machine has been fantastic for making lattes and macchiatos. The steam wand has been easy to use for me (a total beginner). But I'd really like to maximize use out of this machine and get some tasty espresso shots out of it as well. 

Sorry for the long post, but I'd appreciate any and all help on how to improve!",1609356621

I'd bought from them once before and they were super knowledgeable and transparent, so he was surprised that when he asked what their recipe was for it they almost seemed insulted, refusing to give him any tips for brewing.

Coffee,Seattleites brewing pour over at home: are you doing anything special with your water?,"I initially wasn’t too convinced about the big difference water chemistry can make when brewing coffee (as long as you have relatively soft and tasty tap water anyway). I thought my pour overs tasted alright. Then I had a pour over in a cafe that was a lot nicer than what I was making at home. I wondered what I could change to make my home brews as nice as what I had in the cafe. At the time, I think there were a lot of posts online about water chemistry and coffee, so I thought I should maybe revisit my skepticism and do a comparison. I bought some distilled water and added some minerals and buffer as per a [Barista Hustle post](https://www.baristahustle.com/blog/diy-water-recipes-redux/). The pour overs brewed with this water were soo much nicer than the ones brewed with my tap water. I was surprised at the difference it made, so I continued to buy distilled water and make “coffee water.”

Fast forward to now. I recently moved to Seattle, and have been making lackluster pour overs at home using tap water. I decided to stop buying gallons of distilled water, as it’s pretty wasteful. So, people who live in Seattle: do you brew with tap water? Do you do anything to it? If you filter it, which brand do you use? Do you add any minerals or buffer?

Edit: After pulling up that Barista Hustle link, I noticed they recently updated it with instructions for remineralizing tap water. I could look up my city’s water report and calculate what’s needed from there. But if any of you in Seattle have already done the work, I’d like to be a bit lazy (and of course share the info with any of you who are also curious).",1609349278

My questions is this: am I better off freezing each bag as it came in the original packaging, or splitting each bag into 18g ziplock baggies for individual use and then freezing all the ziplocks?

Follow-up question: if I freeze individual 18g portions, can I grind them in my 1zpresso JX right out of the freezer, or do I need to thaw the beans to room temperature first?  I understand that grinding frozen produces good coffee; my worry is if frozen beans can hurt the grinder.

Coffee,"After moving across town, I am maddened by ever disappointing coffee","Hi,
I live in NYC and moved apartments mid-year. In my previous apartment, I used to achieve the most wonderful coffee. My ritual was to use $8/lb dark roast beans from a local grocery, grind in a Cuisinart blade grinder, and brew in an ancient Capresso drip mahcine. The coffee was stellar - it was rich, full, acidic, sweet, and ultimately euphoric. Upon moving, I assumed that my subpar setup could be replicated in my new place and left my gear behind. Dozens of items and hundreds of dollars later, I've discovered this isn't the case. I am currently using a Baratza Encore, Melitta Cone, and Bodum electric kettle, and just can't get the same extraction I remember.


My problem is this - even when I've gotten the best results, my coffee doesn't quite taste full and rich. The best cup I've made was delightfully fruity and acidic, but lacked body that I remember having achieved with my old setup. This particular coffee was about $20/lb and very light, which is frustrating for me in that I remember achieving outstanding results with far less than boutique beans. Most of the time, the coffee is either bitter and thin or watery with traces of flavor. I've experimented with different grind settings, ratios, pour over methods etc, and while I can notice differences between all of them, none of them leaves me impressed. 


Some notes: 
When brewing, I've noticed that I have trouble smelling the coffee itself. When making pourover, I often just smell the boiling water/steam, and the coffee smell doesn't fill the room the way I feel I remember it in my previous apt. Thank you so much!!",1609346521

Delonghi has strong brand recognition worldwide as a coffee brand. Braun doesn't. Wonder if they are trying to reposition Braun as a broader brand in specific markets?

Coffee,Can't dial in my shot properly,"Hey guys, long time lurker, first time poster!

My father decided to get himself a lovely Sage Barista Express as an end of year gift. I've been a long time coffee fan, but this is my first real experience dialing in an espresso machine. 

The issue arises with the length of my pull. The grider is giving out grinds that are fine enough for espresso and is on it's finest grind setting. After loading in 18g and tamping, my shot is only pulling for around 10-15 seconds after the first drop hits the cup. The pressure gauge is building up to a little hit higher than what Sage marks as the ""espresso"" range, but not much above that. 

Upping the dose to 22g slows it down a bit, but not enough to land within the 20-30 second range. The beans I'm using are Square Mile's ""Red Brick"" and were only just opened so they're as fresh as can be. I've tried tamping harder, tamping softer, upping the dose, lowering the dose etc etc.  Doesn't seem to make a huge difference.

There seems to be little change the water when it is tipped out immediately after brewing, but the horrible taste is present after the water is left in the boiler for just a couple of hours. After 5 hours, it is pretty strong. I've let other people try this and independently verify it, and I've had a Covid test very recently which came back negative, so it isn't changes in my taste and smell etc.

I used to use BWT filtered water in the machine, but now I use Zero filtered (RO/distilled) water which I mineralise to 170ppm (20 ppm sodium bicarbonate, 60ppm calcium chloride, 90ppm magnesium sulphate). I'm also pretty confident it is not limescale.

Coffee,Rocky Grinder Unable to be set to 0 / burrs will not touch. Unable to find solution. Help please.,"Hoping someone either knows the problem here, or can point me in the right direction. I'll try to be brief. 

I watched both Seattle Coffee Gear, and Whole Latte Love videos on how to service, and clean the Rocky. I am having the issue both with the hopper on, and with it removed. In fact ever since I bought it off of a friend I've never been able to get the grinder below a setting of at 5, and this was twisting the hoper with all of my might to do so. Even then, I can barely get it there.

Over the past few days I did a full strip down, and very thorough cleaning. And even with the hopper removed, I still cannot get the burs to touch, as pointed out in the WLL video. In other videos as well, I've seen how easily people demonstrate the ease with which the rocky is adjustable down to setting zero. Once mine starts to get down past about 20, it starts to become noticeably more difficult, and below 10 is fairly demanding. 

I found some other threads here on reddit, and on at home barista, but everything seems to say the same thing. Clean the burs, the threads thoroughly, etc. Mine are extremely clean, I painstakingly cleaned them over the past few days, and I feel about close to 100% confident that the issue is no longer built up bean residue / it being dirty. 

I am also positive the threads are not crossed. I even applied some light olive oil to the threads, and cannot get them any closer, and if they are, only fractionally. I would say I am most likely stuck at about the same approximate area I would be with the hopper on.

Coffee,Gooseneck kettle transition trouble - help,"Hi r/Coffee

I recently received a lovely and thoughtful OXO gooseneck kettle as a gift. It pours like a dream and obviously the control of the pour is much better than the standard kettle I had, which had quite a wide mouth. 

Using it on a V60 size 2. 

I didn't change my standard beans. I didn't change the grind. Nothing changed but the kettle. 

**The results after a few days are very lackluster.**  My sense is the grounds are *underextracted*, though the total brew time hasn't really changed. 

**I have a couple of hypotheses:** 

1) The gentler pouring isn't agitating the grounds as much as before, leading to an underextracted final product. 

2) The circumference of the gooseneck kettle is smaller than the original, and the overall temperature of the water, though boiling, is actually lower than the water used with the original kettle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced a similar problem when making a transition to a gooseneck kettle?  Any and all suggestions and wisdom appreciated as always!",1609295834

Both bags have the same expiration date of May 2021, my question is which bag is ""fresher"" and keep longer? My ignorant brain seems to think ""Bag A"" due to it being sealed, but then if that's case, why wouldn't all the bags seem like Bag A?

Most people in Melbourne are also disgusted at the idea of somebody waking up to a self-made coffee (unless the espresso is pulled from a $2k machine they use in case of emergency, like needing a fifth coffee at 6pm after all the cafes are shut). 

All my friends and work colleagues agree that they would never move overseas at risk of the coffee being horrible.

Coffee,Shifted from Baratza Encore to LIDO 2 -- Chemex still coming out sour/bitter [ADVICE NEEDED],"I created a post about my methodology and issues relating to coffee that I've been brewing coming out either sour or bitter with my Baratza Encore: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/k3n5i0/slow\_brew\_advice\_needed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/k3n5i0/slow_brew_advice_needed/)

The issue seems to be lurking and maybe every 1 in 10 cups turns out great.  Now, I've got a LIDO 2 hand grinder that I'm still getting used to adjusting (anywhere between 22 to 26 ticks for Chemex), and the coffee comes out smelling great and looks consistent in grind from my eye.  Once the water hits the coffee, it starts to immediately lose the great smell and begins smelling either sour, bitter, or burnt.  The taste that follows is pretty reminiscent of the same description.

I've since gotten an AirScape to try to maintain the freshness of the coffee in the most airtight container I could, and have now begun using a more expensive grinder, but still have issues.  At this point, the only two things that could be causing an issue are the water or the gooseneck kettle.  I can't imagine the gooseneck kettle is having issues, because it's been cleaned regularly to remove minerals.  I've typically been using tap water, and just tried using brita filtered water with little help to the taste.  

Tomorrow, I'm going to test out some spring water, but really am getting desperate for advice on how to start tasting good quality chemex coffee again.  It seems like no matter what I do, I get the same result of either sour or bitterness, despite my grind adjustment.  Another note is that this is not limited to chemex, I've had the same experience with the kalita wave.  

I've also tried a handful of methods for brewing a chemex (pulse pours and continuous pours), with similar results.",1609280386

I'm brand new to the /r/coffee community. I've been using french press for most of the year but just recently got into buying beans, a grinder, etc. to try and make some better coffee. My scale and aeropress just came in the mail, so I rushed to make an afternoon cup to try it out.

I've been watching a bunch of recipes so I'm fairly familiar with how the process works. I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdKVS5X0vJ0) recipe. I followed all the steps and got to the part where I had to flip the aeropress over, which I was a little nervous about (the recipe uses the inverted method). I nailed it - didn't spill a drop. So I started pressing. Felt pretty cool.

About 5 seconds into the press I realized that I forgot to press the excess air out before flipping it over. No big deal, I thought, I 'll just flip the aeropress back over and press out the air.

So I flipped the aeropress over, dumping the coffee in my mug all over the table and my lap. Just fucking EVERYWHERE. The true home-brew experience. 

I was determined to drink some coffee, so I continued the process anyway. With a soaked table and aeropress, I pressed out the air, flipped it back over, and finished the press. The coffee tasted good! Would have been a lot better if I didn't baptize myself in it though.",1609277492

I recently got a coffee machine (DeLonghi ECZ351 to be exact) and a lot of coffee for christmas and have a few questions, other advice (videos, tips etc) is appreciated also.

Firstly, I have been given pre ground coffee, and whole beans - 3 bags of each. My parents were unsure on what exactly to get so they went with both. I've been looking around and people are frowning upon using pre-ground coffee. I understand it's a matter of grind size, freshness and dose but as it's labelled cafetiere/filter I feel like it's probably ground too finely and not that fresh compared to beans. I do have a cafetiere and could use that alongside steamed milk from the machine instead.

Secondly, how do I go about using the beans and ground coffee to enjoy it the most. Dates wise, what's best to use first, beans or ground? What happens if I open them and start using them, is there a better way to store them etc. 

Lastly, I'm completely unaware on shots, double shots, how to make certain drinks (mostly latte, cappucino, flat white and cortados). I've looked around and some places say double shot others say single for a cappucino for example. Are double shots better to pour that single and is there an accurate place I can find for measurements for drinks?

tea,I think my boss is giving my baristas erroneous information about tea! Help!,"Hi r/tea,

I am the director of education for my small coffee company. I oversee about 8 employees and ensure that they meet all sorts of standards for coffee service and knowledge, like processing methods at the farm level and preparation in the cafe. 

My coffee company recently started sourcing its own teas, which is great because I love tea for all the same reasons that I love coffee. However, I wasn’t consulted before my boss distributed some educational material to my baristas, and a lot of the information therein seems to run contrary to what I’ve learned about tea over my career working in specialty coffee.

We offer western style tea service. Everything is to-go due to COVID, so we put a tea bag in a 16oz cup and add hot water from our FETCO brewer that is probably between 195F and 205F. With that in mind, here are some of the issues I have with my boss’s educational material that I am looking for clarification on:

1. “White teas need a long steep time because it is the only tea that isn’t rolled during processing, which leaves the cell structures intact.”

I’ve always treated white teas similarly to green teas. In past conversations with the owners of tea companies (like Song Tea out of San Francisco), it was generally suggested white teas benefit from lower temperature water and shorter steep times in the range of 2-3 minutes. 

2. “Oolong tea leaves require water that is at or just below boiling.”

I’ve always understood that oolongs greatly benefit from much lower temperature water.

3. “Black teas made from spring picked buds benefit from a lower water temperature.”

This is the first time I’ve heard about lower temperatures for black teas at all. I was under the assumption that there wasn’t really a distinction between brewing black teas that were harvested at different times of the year. 

Am I out of the loop a bit? Are my assumptions and prior experiences with western style tea brewing amiss?

I recently rediscovered some tea that I got gifted a couple years back (well actually my sister got it gifted by Taiwanese hotel guests and gave it to me, since she doesn't drink that much tea) which I was amazed with after I finally gave it a try.  I still have some supply left, but I'm curious about what kind of tea that is so that I can reorder it in the future. Here are a couple of photos a few of my leftover packages: https://imgur.com/a/LQUVUAG

I assume it's some kind of Oolong tea, because it says it's from Taiwan and the tea leaves are mostly small and rounded. The pack I opened today has leaves that are not rounded but a little longer (it reminded me of some kind of black tea?!).

Any help on that matter would be highly appreciated. I absolutely love this tea, I drink it every day (2-4 liters, I just poure it over and over, I hope it's not too much...!??) and it somehow suppresses my hunger (lost some weigth, but don't know if this is connected).

This is the 2nd green oolong in my life - again from TTC. It's almost twice as cheap compared to the Longfengxia green oolong and I like it more. It's way more fragrant and I actually love these more floral notes. It has slight tiny bitter feel at the back of my throat but it's not something bad. 

I think that if I didn't know that this is a green oolong, I would've thought that it is a very good green tea. I'm not a fan of green tea, but this is really pleasant. Also it's my first ""baozhong"" whatever this means (Google says ""wrapped tea""), but I would buy this again. The floral notes are intense (my flower memory is not very good but probably lilac+jasmine?) and I enjoyed it for 5 infusions, then becames a little flat but I stopped at the 10th infusion (still fragrant, but watery in taste)

I think that the price is very reasonable ($0.32/g) for the awesome floral fragrance and nice light taste, probably cheaper because of the lower altitude, but it's still a Wild West to determine why one tea is expensive and other cheap. But this was a good surprise in terms of price and quality. I will try brewing it in 85-90C water next time but even if I can't remove the slight bitterness, it's still very good, one of my faves : 9/10! Definitely recommend it (lot 929)!

I enjoy getting a cup of filter coffee from one of the nice coffee shops near me. I don't like any other types of coffee, just a nice, balanced, black filter coffee.

I've been trying to replicate this at home without success. I've tried an Aeropress, V60, Kalita Wave, french press etc.

I've followed recipes, tried different amounts, timed it, worked the weights etc. I've got super fresh beans, ground as needed in a conical burr grinder.

Coffee,Are there any travel mugs out there that won't make my coffee taste like metal or plastic?,"I have a problem with travel mugs. I refuse to believe that there is not one travel mug in the world that won't alter the taste of my coffee in some way. I just tell myself that I haven't found it yet.

I have a Fellow Carter mug. I purchased it because of the ceramic coating and because it says it won't alter the taste of my coffee. I also have a Stanley Ceramivac mug (same ceramic coating). I prefer the Stanley because the ceramic goes all the way up. The Carter does not coat the lip.

But, these mugs both have one common denominator: the silicone that prevents the coffee from spilling. I don't quite understand it, but I believe the condensation from my coffee is dripping off the silicone and then down into my coffee. Then, I get coffee tasting like plastic. It's actually worse than the metallic taste I get from stainless steel mugs, but those usually use silicone as well.

Preferably, I want a mug that is at least leakproof and will keep my coffee hot for 2-3 hours at the minimum. I also don't want it altering the taste of my coffee. Probably a big ask. The only other option that I can think of is to just keep the lids off. Maybe someone could 3D print me some friction-fitting lid with no silicone or something. That'd be neat.

Coffee,Coffee grinder for both espresso and pour over (not switching back and forth regularly),"Hello!

I’ve been grinding coffee using a Porlex hand grinder for two years now for french press, Kalita, V60 and Chemex. 

I’m saving up for an espresso machine (very likely a Rocket Apartamento) and I’d like to purchase an electric grinder to complement it. 

While saving up for the machine I intend to use the grinder for pourovers, and eventually when I get the machine, the grinder will be permanently dialled in for espresso. (Which is why I mention in the topic that I’m not switching back and forth regularly)

I’ve shortlisted two grinders that I like: the Rocket Faustino and Eureka Mignon Silenzio, but do these grinders grind coarse enough for pourovers?

Any other recommendations are welcome!  Budget is &lt;$700~",1609254694
Coffee,Sustainable/recycled coffee: can it be or is it good? I'm a bit of a coffee newbie so I'd like some more knowledge on this kind of thing,"Started brewing coffee at home (v60) this year, and it's really become a big hobby of mine. Whilst I am new to it, I would like to think I'm not completely naive about coffee at this point, although I'm definitely still a novice. 

So for Christmas, my sister's girlfriend asked me what I would like, so I said not really sure, maybe something coffee related. She's very into sustainability, the environment and all that, which is good. 

She got me these beans from a roastery in their city, which I was excited about as they had both been telling me how great a shop it was (I had meant to go visit it sometime but the coronavirus put a stop to that), and she told me that these were a special bean the shop did, where they took the left over beans from the days roasts, and put them together and roasted them all to an even level. When I heard this I was quite sceptical as it sounded like that meant they were just the scraps and the shop was trying to save on waste. I didn't say anything at the time as I didn't want to seem ungrateful, but I did think there was no way these were gonna be good. 

So on boxing Day I'm back in my home and I decide why not might as well brew them, and surprise surprise they are beyond terrible. Looks wise, they are all an even blackness, not even brown anymore just straight up black. They taste so roasted and bitter. I tried to make a few espresso with them and they aren't great either, next to no flavour at all apart from bitter. 

I'm not going to tell them, I'm just wondering if this is a common thing that shops do. When they bought them the guy working there said that I was going to really enjoy them if I'm a coffee person, which I am.",1609254015

Coffee,Do I have a problem with my Bialetti Brikka moka pot?,"I use a Bialetti Brikka moka pot and I’ve been having trouble getting a decent coffee out of it lately, so I’m wondering whether I have a problem with the pot.

My biggest gripe is that I seem to be getting a very low volume of coffee from the initial amount of water that I put in, and I seem to have a lot of water left in the bottom chamber after the brew finishes bubbling and is ready. The water in the chamber is also clearly full of coffee - is this correct or a sign of something being wrong?:

Here’s a picture of my post-brew coffee and the bottom chamber full of brown water:

I fill with filtered water to the notch indicated in the top chamber, which is just over 80ml as you can see from the photo here:

Post-brew I still have just under 30ml of water left in the bottom, roughly 35% of what I put in to start:

Coffee,Different brew ratios for different origins to highlight origin-specific flavor profiles?,"I noticed that the early parts of the brew tends to have more of the robust chocolatey and fruity flavor. As you start to over-extract, the flavor profile tends to become more nutty/floral. 

With some origins, I want to taste the strong chocolatey/fruity flavor. While others, the floral/nutty tastes are quite nice. 

So far, I noticed that Panama Gesha's floral/tea like notes comes later on in the extraction. I also notice the Ethiopia one, in particular, has nice floral notes near the end. Although the lighter flavor profile of the crisp fruitiness tends to get diluted if I overextract. I've been doing a first round with a heavy brew ratio, and doing an additional separate brew of an additional 80mL to get that floral cup.

Coffee,How strong is too strong? I've yet to find out,"Background: I started drinking black coffee in 2016 after I visited a couple coffee plantations and got to experience the side by side comparison of many times. I like dark roast, black, and STRONG.

My wife complains that I use too much coffee, whether beans or already ground. I have a decanter that can hold enough coffee grounds for a couple servings. I don't use a measuring device; I just add in more grounds until it looks like it usually does.

Anyway, normally I buy (well, SHE does since she does the shopping) 12 to 16oz packs of beans or grounds of various brands at the grocery store. Today, I bought a big container, 24oz ish, of a name brand coffee, their ""silky dark"" roast, because my wife had a coupon and it was dirt cheap and she was making a stink today about not being able to keep up with my drinking quantity. 

I get home, and she suggests I brew it. I grabbed an old baby formula scoop and counted out 4.5 scoops, a smaller quantity than I normally use in order to appease my wife, which is about 2.5x the recommended amount on the canister. Wow, it tasted so weak to me, though my wife said the strength was just right. Even if I added a little more, my normal amount, it would still taste weak to me.

I may have a problem.",1609231617

But every once in awhile (every other day or so) when pulling a shot, it will start fine and go to about 10 bars, everything will look fine for about 10 - 15 seconds, then all of a sudden one of two things will happen, the pressure will start dropping rapidly to about 4 bars but there is no increase in espresso coming out or I will hear some kind of click and the pressure will drop to zero, then nothing comes out.  When this happens, I stop the pull, remove the portafilter and try to just draw water through the grouphead, usually nothing comes out or it just comes in small drips.  Drawing water through the steam wand is fine, no issues there.

Coffee,Need help upgrading from the Baratza Encore,"I've been using a Baratza Encore for the last \~2 years. The first \~6 months or so was pour over bliss. Then, things started getting...inconsistent. Grind size is all over the place, despite cleaning, recalibrating, upgrading tot he M2 burr. I'm having a hard time nailing down a consistent recipe.  

I could send to Barazta to get it serviced, but I'm interested in looking into an upgrade given how much coffee I drink. I drink pour over, primarily. I'd be willing to spend \~$300-$400. 

What grinders should I look at?

I live in San Francisco a few blocks away from the Fellow retail shop– so the [Fellow Ode](https://fellowproducts.com/products/ode-brew-grinder) has also caught my eye. I know there have been some complaints with the first version and customer service, but figure I may have better luck considering how close I live to them....

Any thoughts/advice greatly appreciated!",1609185753

Coffee,Breville Barista Touch Finally Pulled a Good Shot! Here's what I learned.,"I just got my Barista Touch for Xmas and was hating it for a week while learning to pull a good shot and gleaned some Reddit posts and other forum posts and finally today am happy with my espresso!  Here are some tips for anyone with this unit having a hard time.

1) Use fresh beans (within 3 days of roast date)

2) The default setting for grind size is 12, I was getting sour watery shots with 12, and revised it to 8.   Some have also changed the burr setting, but I haven't done that yet, and got a great shot today.  I know some hate on the grinder, but at setting 8 it seems very fine like powder to me and helped me pull a great shot.

3) Level the grounds before tamping to ensure even distribution (I made this huge mistake last week of just tamping after grinding without leveling first).

4) Practice tamping, I am a bigger guy so it's not hard for me to use 40lbs tamp pressure, but for some smaller folks, it may be a challenge.

5) The default brew time is 25 sec, 30 sec was the correct time for me.

Still learning so forgive any ignorance, but I got the perfect shot today (not sour or bitter, not watery or too concentrated).  I'm super stoked and wanted to share!",1609184459

Coffee,1zpresso JX Pro first impressions review,"I received jx pro for Christmas this year.  It is replacing a handground grinder.

The JX Pro is incredibly well built and very sturdy.
Overall it takes a bit more work to grind then the hand ground but, the burrs are larger so that is expected.

I don't know if I would ever use this though for espresso or turkish.  I would be spending all morning to pull 1 or 2 shots.

The grind size though is much more consistent and as expected the few cups that I have made using my aeropress are much more consistent and we'll rounded.

The mug that I love using for tea is 16 oz, 450 ml and I asked in my local tea shop and an employee guessed that the medium finum filter would fit fine. Well, it almost, sort of fits? The sides are in the mug instead of out. I was thinking about returning it and getting the large but all the photos I'm seeing online are of tea pots, definitely larger dan 16 oz. The measurements seem okay, but my fear here is that the medium is a little too small, but the large a little too big due to the weird shape of the mug. Small at the bottom, big at the top. Similar to nr. 12 in this picture https://www.luxurybonechina.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/all-mug.jpg

tea,my thoughts on tea and meditation,"I'm realizing that using tea to enhance meditation might not be the way, since the calmness from it is very temporary and I miss the point of mindfulness which is to **observe**, rather than cling to an experience.

Rather, it may be better for me to have tea drinking as the meditation itself. Like observing the sensory experience of heating the water, steeping the tea, pouring it into the cup, smelling the aroma, and carefully observing the taste. Not my idea, but something that has been around: ""Tea meditation""

""A tea meditation involves being mindful and present during all aspects of the tea ritual, including making the tea, drinking the tea, and being aware of the effects on your mind and body. ""  - from the link below

I tried 3 or 4 Taiwanese cultivars and I think I have my favorite - Qing Xin. In all of the Qing Xin oolongs and even one Qing Xin black tea from Shanlinxi I feel some really nice syrupy sweetness with fresh resin notes, which I absolutely love. I ditched sugar and any additives because of this sweet fragrance, I can almost feel the sweetness on my tongue. I never knew that there are so fragrant teas in the world. I'm glad that a bunch of people here suggested me to try some Taiwanese tea. Thank you all.

This oolong on the picture is my first high mountain oolong (the only high mountain tea was the Shanlinxi black) I had, but more importantly it is the first green oolong I tried from the samples. And I will be honest - it's not my favourite, even though it's one of the most expensive teas I currently have  (probably top3 with price $0.52/g). I'm definitely not disappointed, but I prefer the cheaper low altitude summer bug bitten teas to this. I probably sound blasphemous, but I feel it that way: more oxidised = warmer and sweeter (idk if it's always true). It's too green for me and it is very ""strong"" if that makes any sense for such light-colored liquor - I can feel very slight and almost non-existent bitterness with a little dryness after the 4th infusion. It is good though - the resin + honey smell is there, even though it's less fragrant it is much more complex than what I've tried before, and while I was drinking it I was thinking of oil? Could a tea be called oily? This doesn't sound right, but if you've tried a thicker vinegar it has the same ""oiliness"". As for the fragrance I can feel more green notes like steamed spinach and this time some pine needles, rosmary needles... this kind of freshness (I find pine needles similar to resin for some reason). Anyway, my imagination is too wild as my main hobby is cooking so I relate everything to food for some reason. Anyway, It's very good, I enjoyed it a lot and it remained strong, aromatic and tasty for 12 infusions, really long lasting tea and overall I can give it 8/10, but I will probably not buy it again as it's expensive. But I will look for more oxidised versions of this Longfengxia Qing Xin for sure.

Have you ever tried this one? I didn't find much info for it. I think that it's not that famous, but I'm glad I tried it. As always I'm open to suggestions for other green oolongs to try because now I'm intrigued even though I prefer the darker ones. Are there any baked/roasted green oolongs or when you bake it, it's no longer green? Probably silly question, sorry :D I'm still learning the different teas and how they are made. The description of this particular green oolong says ""baking level: none"". How is it so green then (you know enzymes and things like this)? Steamed? So there should be baked green oolongs just like the roasted green teas! Anyways, I will stop thinking ""out loud"" and I will wait for someone more knowledgeable than me to explain. Thanks in advance! :)",1607517073
tea,What's your 'bread&amp;butter' Oolong tea (and source)?,"Hey there,

I'm aware that there are loads of different teas. 

I love Oolong teas and although I was probably 'ripped off' I really enjoyed the 'Red Robe' tea by the 'rare tea company'. I also liked more floral Oolong teas from Taiwan. 

When I was searching for anything that comes close I was drawn into some rabbit hole surrounding all the intricacies, mislabelings and fallacies of buying tea. 

Is there a simple way to find good tea, that is not super expensive? Maybe you know the kind of tea from [raretea](https://raretea.co) co (the red robe on) - it's a bit more woody, savory and earthy, but not pungent or bitter - rather like bread or something. Any idea were I can find something like that for a good price? 

I know that organic tea is usually even more expensive but I'd  be really happy to find something organic and affordable as well. 

What would be your go-to source and type of tea, if you were to buy two or three different kinds of Oolong teas (and maybe some black or green tea) for the next couple of months? I don't really like Mu'er tea that much... 

Any advice is welcome. Note: I live in Europe (Germany).",1607516992

tea,Hi. I'm new and I like earl grey (black?). That's the extent of my knowledge.,"I took a trip to Thailand and was bored in my hotel room. There was an electric kettle with coffee and tea. Coffee is gross and I'm a Star Trek fan ^(bet y'all get that enough that I don't need to explain) so out of boredom I tried the tea. To my surprise, I really liked it! So when I got home I got a box of Twinings earl grey, excited to have a cup. It wasn't worth the time it took to boil the water (110v outlets, electric kettles are garbage). Been sitting on that box for a couple years. Now I'm bored, and have time. So I gave it another go. I still like it and want to explore. So here I am.

What are the right questions I should be asking to nail down specifics of my particular tastes? I don't like green tea as I know it. I read about Harney and Sons here. Found there is a warehouse located here in Las Vegas so I should be able to find it at the grocery stores. How specific is a term like 'local' (country, continent, hemisphere?) if that's something I want?

Coffee,Bunn G1 grinding metal (cannot adjust properly),"I’ve had a Bunn G1 for a few years now that I’ve been eventually meaning to upgrade and I’m finally getting around to it. I have two seemingly simple objectives right now:

1. Replace the shear plate.

The shear plate I’m currently using is broken — it’s in two pieces, and I’m reasonably certain part of it is missing. I ordered a replacement shear plate a year or two ago, but apparently I ordered the wrong one. I received the 05852.0001 when apparently I need the 05852.0000. So I’m stuck with the broken shear plate right now

2. Install the trifecta plate.

This was easy enough and seems like it should be working.



So I’ve disassembled my grinder and then reassembled it, but the burrs seem to be touching I think. I’m at the point where I’m trying to adjust the burrs so the finest grind setting just barely touches. However, when I turn the grinder on, the burrs are making very loud metallic noises that are clearly not good. Metal is being ground and dropping down the grind chute. Moreover, I don’t even have the adjustment screw attached and this happens (I would think the burrs are as far apart as possible in this state).

Coffee,[Question] Any experience with inconsistent flow/spraying with Rocket Appartamento Espresso Machine?,"I recently bought the Rocket Appartamento Espresso Machine back in August to start drinking espressos and went through the learning curve of pulling a proper shot with beans that I roasted myself several days prior. The consistency and flow of the machine at the start worked really well and pulled really nice shots of espresso. The machine handled 3 consecutive pulls just fine at the beginning with no fluctuation between the 3 pulls. Now when I pull the first shot, the flow is alright, the second pull spatters at the beginning and will then reach a consistent flow but then end by spraying everywhere, and the third pull is a lost cause. I have even tried spacing out the pulls to be 10 minutes apart and that remedies the problem a little bit, however, I still notice problems with the flow.

When I inspect the coffee puck after brewing, there is no channeling occurring that I can see, which makes me wonder why the machine is spraying if there is no apparent channeling.

What I have tried: 

Freshly roasted beans are ground 3 days after roasted on Poppery 1 popcorn poppers on the Rocket Faustino Espresso Grinder to 18 grams.  
A pull time of between 25-30 seconds for 60 mL of espresso   
The grounds are tamped with a gyroscope technique at first and then tamped at a pressure of 30 lbs (this was measured).   
A 58 mm coffee distributor to ensure even distribution of grounds

Coffee,just made my best cup so far!,"   i started drinking coffee after being a staunch tea drinker for years about a month before christmas. with my whole family being coffee lovers and my sister working as a barista, it was bound to happen eventually.  because of this new development, my family got me a bodum 2 piece pour over coffee maker for christmas.
   now whether it was due to my adhd or just me being passionate, i instantly went down the rabbit hole on different techniques and ratios on how to get the best black coffee. my first couple of attempts varied in success, ranging from “a little bitter” to “pour down the sink” but i still enjoyed learning.
   now this is where the title of the post comes into play, because i had 2 pretty major breakthroughs this morning. the first was when i learned that medium-fine grounds give you a more flavorful coffee, so when i got up this morning, i ground up my beans, but this time trying not to grind them too fine. i also did that thing where you warm up the pot with the water for the first time. idk if that affected anything tho. now this is where my second breakthrough came in. when i was doing research last night, i saw someone say that putting an extra filter on top of the built in steel filter gives you a stronger and less bitter coffee. so that’s what i did. i put my coffee in, bloomed it, and then poured just enough to cover the top again. i poured it into my mug, added a bit more hot water, and took a sip. 
   instantly a whole new world opened up. i had never had a cup of black coffee so flavorful, so smooth, so fruity, so rich, so... good. i had to back away for a second. i was in disbelief. i gave my stepmom a sip, and she said the exact same thing. i finished it about 20 minutes ago, and i can still taste it in my mouth. total game-changer. any other tips for making great fruity black coffee would be much appreciated. 

TLDR: i didn’t grind my coffee as fine and added an extra filter on top of my built in one and the results passed with flying colors.",1609178369

I used to work at a coffee shop but that was a few years ago.  I've made a few coffees but I'm not really happy with the results.  I am not sure if it's me being out of practice and getting used to a new machine or if its a problem with the machine itself.  It could even be the beans I'm using (a friend gave me some old beans that were espresso ground, but they weren't an espresso roast). I realized what I worked with before and that I can't expect commercial grade in a home brewer but my coffees just aren't that great. 

The espresso brewer doesn't have a tamper so it's hard for me to know how much to press it.  And it has an automatic setting for brew time. It could be that I'm over brewing, but I don't think that's the only problem because it never seems to develop much creama.

The frother is also different. I don't have any metal cups to froth the milk in and I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes.  It also ends up being a lot more bubbly than I'd prefer, I think a part of that is because the frother wand doesn't tilt to an angle. Which makes it hard to caramelize the milk and it tends to overflow.

Usually we can grind enough beans in a minute, minute and a half for 8-10 cups of coffee. Certain bags though will take much longer, over 5 minutes for the same amount of grounds. These grounds will come out powdery, almost fluffy, and actually warm from all of the grinding.

The grinder chute is not clogged, and if we switch to different beans we’re back to our “normal” grind time.

Coffee,Another undecided post,"Hi all

Here is another post asking for advice from more experienced coffee lovers / machine owners.

I am ready to make the jump into this world after wanting an espresso machine for quite a while.


For the past few days I have been reading and watching reviews but it seems that by doing so I end up with more choices and as others, I end up in a rabbit hole with soooo many tempting options.



I will try to include as many details as I can maybe it helps:


First of all, I mainly drink machiattos and piccolos and occasionally I may have 1/2 lattes for guests so for this reason I narrowed it down to SBDUs as it seems it will suffice my needs and it's a good balance budget and maintenance wise.

I feel in love with 2 beans from a local coffee shop so I will mainly use the same beans from the same roaster but from time to time I also want to experiment different ones.

Not really a fan of dark roasts, more into medium or sometimes light roasts and have about 3-4 espressos a day and will rarely be the case of back-to-back drinks.

After a few though days and decisions I think I narrowed it down and my main option at the moment would be the Lelit Victoria.

The reasons I think this is a good choice:
LCC and 58mm as opposed to other Lelit options such as Anna (PID) or Grace which both are 57mm.

I have considered at the beginning Silva and Gaggia Classic but money wise it's not a big difference ahen you factor in PID and OPV.

The Victoria is on offer at Caffe Italia in the UK for £699.

Also, it seems that other options such as used one are not so widely available on ebay here in the UK.

Finally, let's talk grinder.

Everyone praised Niche Zero but out of stock so in between Sette 270Wi and Mignon Specialita but more towards the Mignion.
Open to other suggestions also.

Budget: Not really a set budget but I prefer it around the £1000-1200 mark although can stretch it.

Coffee,"Lido ET producing lots of fines, should I realign it?","I've had my Lido ET since late August of this year, and it's been fantastic. For the past month, however, I've noticed that it's been producing notably more fines than usual. I primarily grind light roasted beans, so I attributed the fines to that. However, I recently picked up a dark roast and am having the same issue. I'll grind 24.6 grams of coffee (to account for any fines that get trapped above the receptacle), but that only yields ~23 grams of grounds, with the remaining 1.6 grams being fines that stuck to the sides of the rings. Here's an example to show what I'm talking about after grinding said dark roast at 1+7: http://imgur.com/gallery/9OIGnty

I've tried tapping the sides and bottom of the grinder to get these into the receptacle, but they're nearly all fines and it makes my cups taste worse. Even still, when I shake my receptacle I can see quite a few fines. Whatever isn't fine grounds is INCREDIBLY consistent, but the amount of fines I'm seeing leads me to believe that my grinder might be misaligned. I brush the bottom of the burrs after every use and give it a deep clean every 2-3 weeks, so it's not like these are lingering fines building up from previous brews.

Is this normal for the Lido ET or should I bite the bullet and realign it?",1609170391
Coffee,Just made my first ever “proper” coffee using my new aeropress for the first time!,"Have been drinking instant coffee for years until I stumbled across a James Hoffman video a few months ago. Fast forward a few months and I’ve just been give an aeropress, a bag of coffee, a book on coffee and a milk frother for Christmas! 

For my first time I used the inverted method with roughly 15g of coffee. I filled the chamber to just above the number 4 and then filled to the number 1. Then stirred it 5/6 times and left for a minute before slowly plunging until it hissed a bit (wasn’t entirely sure when to stop or if it mattered) 

It definitely tasted better than the instant stuff I normally use but slightly bitter - could well be because I tend to have sugar though. I’d now like to try different methods with different coffees to get a feel for the varying flavours 

My plan is to use up this pre-ground coffee from Rave and then look at getting a Timemore C2 and some proper beans! 

Any tips or comments for first starting to use the aeropress and first getting into coffee?",1609170149
Coffee,Getting into pour over coffee but no where to buy coffee. UK,"So... I bought my girlfriend a bodum pour over coffee maker for Xmas with the stainless steel washable filter.

We both drink coffee daily but my girlfriend wanted to start drinking black coffee. Although we have good success making coffee with milk she finds the espresso from our duo temp pro a little bitter / harsh. We have tried a few different types methods and types of coffee with no luck.

I bought the pour over maker to see if we have any better luck with that but have no coffee to try it out with.

Coffee,Shallow versus deep outfall burrs,"As I understand it, deep outfall (size of hole when both burrs are lined together) burrs will grind faster, releasing grounds faster but will have more fluctuation in ground particles.  Shallow outfall will not grind as fast but will be more uniform grounds.

On a commercial grinder, I would not think the speed would be much different unless doing pounds plural.  So why would one want deeper outfall burrs?  Is there some coffee application where those grounds would be wanted?  If not, why would anyone every want the deeper burrs - I would think with even pounds of coffee, you would only save a minute or so in grinding time.",1609168471
Coffee,Coffee event for New Years Day.,"Hello all, I am seeking some inspiration and/or advice. The hosts of the New Years party I am attending this year have heard that I am a “coffee geek” and would love some sort of coffee event during that day.

The first thing my mind went to was doing a coffee cupping for them as I think it is always eye-opening to taste different coffees and being able to compare them. However, I have only done small cuppings in the past and always in my home, we are going to be 9 people so I was wondering if there was a way to give the guests the enjoyment of being able to compare different types of coffee without the setup of a cupping. I don’t have enough spoons or suitable vessels. I was thinking of doing 4 different coffees, could I brew them in, say, a Moccamaster back to back and then store them in thermoses and when all 4 ready serve them and then people could compare? I know it’s not ideal but if I can avoid the hassle of doing a large cupping new years day and still give the guests an enjoyable time comparing.

Would this brewing method be acceptable or should I not even bother?. If not do you have any other suggestions as to a coffee related event or happening I could do? Also do you have any suggestions as to which 4 different coffees I should pick in order to get the most range?

Thanks and a happy new year to you all!",1609166050
Coffee,One Year Ago I Quit Caffeine. This Is How Life Has Changed.,"One year ago I did something many of my nearest and dearest thought to be crazy, dramatic and “he won’t last more than a week” — I suddenly quit caffeine, cold turkey.

My daily intake was high; caffeine had always been a second oxygen to me. The average day looked something like:

Between 7–10 cups of tea
2–3 cappucinos, either made at home/in the office or from a cafe
400mg of caffeine prior to working out, to get in extra reps

It equated to around 1,100 mg of caffeine per day, more than double the FDA-recommended upper limit of 400 mg per day for a “healthy” adult.

I’m an adult male, so I’m ignorant by default…so please park the above information….for a minute.

Refocus. It’s time to solve a mystery.

At the same time, I was trying to get to the bottom of a very confusing and debilitating anxiety issue. It was all-consuming to me. 

Medication wasn’t working, I started a very intense strength training regime hoping to alleviate it but found that, while I was getting through the workouts and seeing good results, my gym sessions were fueled with intrusive thoughts and worries about having a panic attack. I’d often see friends and colleagues at the gym, so this was a genuinely deep-rooted fear.

Have you put two and two together yet? 

Because I hadn’t!

But I did, one day, while walking to the gym. It was an epiphany of sorts.

“You have just taken 400 mg of caffeine pills — THIS is what’s making you a tightly-wound ball of anxiety — Idiot”.

After fighting against my thoughts yet again for another workout, I came home and brewed a cup of decaf tea. When my wife came home, I told her I had news…

After watching the colour drain out of her, expecting me to announce divorce, a baby with another woman or a lottery win (sorry), I said it…
As of now, I am giving up caffeine. For good.

A year has passed. Over 365 days. 12 months. 

Hundreds of thousands of potential milligrams of caffeine. And it’s been absolutely transformational.

I’ll say that again:

GIVING UP CAFFEINE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY TRANSFORMATIONAL

This left me with more energy, happiness and clarity on the things in life that are important. My moods became iron-clad steady and my ability to focus on work and complicated tasks became a whole lot easier when I wasn’t tying them to the up-and-down energy roller coaster of drinking caffeine, or thinking about the next caffeine “hit”.

WITHDRAWAL WAS REAL, BUT BRIEF

The first day was tough. Screaming headache, intense hunger, and I was so irritable I’d have murdered anyone who got within two feet of me. I stayed home and locked the door — literally (in fact, I spent most of the day in bed).

But it lasted about thee days. The headaches subsided every day, I felt my body and brain stabilizing and I quickly found myself not missing caffeine anymore — although I totally respect that everyone will have different experiences with withdrawal.

MY SLEEP GOT SO GOOD, AND I DIDN’T NEED CAFFEINE TO WAKE UP

By far the biggest comment/question I got when I told people I’d given up caffeine was, “How the hell can you wake up in the morning? I need caffeine to function”.

Well, my sleep became so deep and restorative that I’d bound out of bed at 6:30am every day absolutely oozing with energy — enough to tackle 90 minutes of intense workout with just water.

Here’s the thing, I drank so much caffeine it was affecting my sleep, so I needed more caffeine to wake up in the morning (see the cycle here?!). When I got rid of the thing unbalancing my energy levels all day and forcing me to sleep poorly, I no longer needed it to wake up.

Even today — I have more energy in the morning than I’ve ever had in my life, and I credit that to the stable, high-quality sleep I enjoy from not allowing caffeine to mess up my system.

DAYTIME FATIGUE EFFED OFF

My day usually consisted of periods of intense energy, then huge dips where I’d sometimes literally nod off in a chair. Of course, it was that damn caffeine.

While I thought the increased alertness and mood after a “hit” was good and productive, I spent just as much time sinking into the depths of fatigue and irritability afterwards.

I now find days to be fairly steady in terms of high energy levels, with an amazing ability to focus on tough tasks. There’s no more ups and downs.

CHRONIC MIGRAINES ALSO EFFED OFF

They run in our family. As my wife knows, for one or two days a month, I was non-functioning and effectively useless.

I remember the signs; waking up at 2am (it was always 2am!) with a feeling of pressure in my head, ringing ears and a tiny pain above one of my eyes. That was the ticking time bomb; by 6am I’d be in full-blown migraine mode with a headache I’d literally be happy to die to escape, throwing up, compulsive rocking, soaking wet in sweat even though I was freezing and fairly often some good old-fashioned crying.

I could write the next 24 hours off, too, feeling hungover and sluggish in that lovely post-migraine phase. If you suffer, you’ll know exactly what I mean.

Since giving up caffeine I’ve had one migraine, when I should have had around 25. It came after a particularly stressful week — but I can safely credit caffeine with eradicating yet another dangerous, life-sapping health issue.

SOME CAFES BECAME OFF-LIMITS, AND SOME JUST HAD BAD DECAF

Without naming them, I had two particular establishments that catered so perfectly to my caffeine addiction. But, to be honest, their decaf options were shit.

So I stopped going. It was a shame, and they’re not to blame for my finicky life choices, but I no longer frequent them because decaf products are a lazy after-thought for many local and global cafe chains.

Oh yes — I also don’t spend so much time waiting in lineups, or getting angry at the guy who has been staring at the donuts for 10 minutes but waited until he got to order before deciding which one he actually wants.

BUT IT’S TOTALLY POSSIBLE TO REPLICATE THEM AT HOME

I invested in a “proper” espresso machine, with an industry-standard milk steamer, etc. And I buy good quality decaf beans and decaf tea.
I learned how to make amazing coffee at home, which really helps when setting off for work in the morning, when I’d have previously driven through one of my usual cafes.

A year later, it just tastes like coffee and tea. I don’t think I miss the taste of “proper” caffeinated products at all.

SO I SAVED A TON OF MONEY

At one point, I was refilling the App for my particular favourite cafe twice a week, at $25 a pop. That’s $2,600 a year, which is as much gas as I use, or the same cost as a nice city break away for the weekend.

Most cafes’ decaf products are so awful, I now just opt to make them at home, where a $20 bag of coffee lasts me a month.

Literally, I can feel the additional cash in my pocket every month now I’m not running to buy cappuccinos multiple times each day.

CAFFEINE IS IN EVERYTHING! AND YOU’LL KNOW WHEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY DRANK IT

How dumb was I? We were in Florida for a week, about a month after I gave up caffeine, and I drank a lot of Diet Coke — rivers of the stuff. 

That same week, I was confused by a sudden spike in anxiety, just as I thought I had gotten over it.

Of course, there was caffeine in the soda. Duuuuh.

I also discovered, often triggered by an intense rush of anxiety or nervousness, that there’s caffeine in:

Chocolate
Pain and cold medication
Some ice cream
Most soft drinks

It took a while to learn exactly what was on and off-limits, while also understanding two things:
You won’t completely eliminate caffeine. Even decaf coffee and tea contains trace amounts
Some cafes WILL give you regular coffee/tea sometimes by mistake. You’ll know exactly when, but don’t blame them.

MY SEX LIFE

Yeah, I’m not going there. I know you were curious how it affects the Leaning Tower of Penis, but I’m keeping that a mystery.

CONCLUSION

Post-caffeine life has been great. It took a lot of adjustment, learning and some more readjustment, but life is now in a great rhythm that just feels “normal”.

Yes I can’t enjoy some of the cafes I used to, and I’m stuck with boring old Sprite whenever I go to Subway, but life without migraines, anxiety and disrupted sleep has made it well worth the snap decision.

Would I go back to caffeine? Honestly? 

Absolutely not. These days, I just don’t see any benefit it could bring me.

Should you give it up? Probably not — if it works for you.

My decision was deeply personal, and I’m not going to burst into some crazy activism against the evil caffeine Gods, because there’s no justification.

Everyone has a different relationship with, and sensitivty to caffeine. Do whatever works for you. As Dwight Schrute days, “They’re your oats”.

So enjoy your next brew, caffeine-free or not.",1609164641

Coffee,UK - Prices for Wilfa Uniform are really high right now - so manual options?,"Sorry, its yet another ""which grinder"" thread - but I think its fair to say that everyone has slightly different needs

I did quite a bit of research (starting from literally zero!) last month, and I'd decided on a Wilfa Uniform - but whilst waiting for my superauto to sell, they've largely gone out of stock in the UK, and those that remain have inflated in price to the point where I'm thinking ""you know, manual would be fine actually"".

I'm currently re-watching JH's ultimate hand grinder video, but I know that there are some grinders missing that I've seen in other posts on here, plus, it seems its more espresso-focussed.

&amp;#x200B;

Budget is £100-150, but could push if there's a compelling reason.  Bear in mind the Uniform will eventually come back to the £230 range, and that seems to be an excellent choice for me.

I want to use it with a clever dripper.  I don't plan to make espresso anymore, that isn't a concern.

Its going to sit on a shelf in the kitchen, so something that looks nice would be great.  Its also a reason why I'm thinking about going manual - it'll take up less space.

I don't know much about grinders, so I don't really want anything that I need to ""calibrate"", I need to it be correct out of the box, and I'd like something that isn't going to break on me after a year or so.

Coffee,Brewing time change with time,"Hey all!

I am a long time lurker here. Firstly thank you for all those tips and tricks you all share here, they've upped my coffee game from instant coffee powder to V60. 

I recently started brewing via a V60 setup (Hario Mini Mill+Plastic V60-2cups size dripper+ V60 paper filters (NL make)+drip scale). To try out different beans, I started out by visiting a coffee roaster near me and was able to settle down on one particular set of beans that matches my flavor palate. I try to finish up the entire batch (freshly roasted) within 2 weeks, but I notice that although I retain the same grinding size on the grinder, the brewing time varies slowly over the weeks. I use Hoffman's technique, and on day 1 it brews at 3:10 and by day 14 it brews by 3:30. I really like the taste with the 3:10 brew time and can figure out the different flavors present in the beans, but by the end of 2 weeks, it doesn't taste the same and becomes more diluted. I have been observing it for the last few months to ensure that I am not making any changes/adjustments to the setup. 

How can I ensure the consistency of the flavor?

I use the same resealable pouch that the roaster provides to store my beans, could that be the start?",1609150954
Coffee,Espresso extraction time vs quantity,"So I’ve recently bought myself a conical burr grinder, which is amazing as I’m finally getting consistent grinds!! 

I have a question though. On the finest setting the coffee is so fine that my espresso machine struggles more to push the hot water through the coffee. I’m extracting for 28 seconds, which gives me around 50ml of coffee from 14g of grinds. 

I usually use one stage coarser grind, which gives me around 70ml of coffee rpm 14g of grinds. But the coffee I’m drinking from the 50ml extraction actually tastes stronger. Is this right as it’s able to extract more flavour under the higher pressure, or am I imagining this?",1609149995

Equipment: Breville infuser using 53mm portafilter. Using capresso burr grinder, dialed on the last “click” of “fine” setting.

I’ve read 18 grams is ideal for a double shot basket. I’ve attempted to do that and it’s very obvious that basket just can’t handle 18g of ground coffee. If you own this machine, what has been your experience? For me, 14g seems to the sweet spot.

2) Tamping: with so many videos on YT, some say tamp, some say they don’t care. Any feedback from the infuser owners would certainly be useful .

Coffee,Should I buy Barista Pro?,"A bit of background. I’ve been using capsule machines for 15 years and I drink mostly espresso and americano (at least 4-5 a day). My wife drinks a latte or cappuccino once or twice a week.

About 6 month ago, I decided to move to the next stage (or so I thought) and bought an automatic machine (Gaggia Cadorna Milk) and I’m so disappointed by the result. Flat, bitter coffee with a watery texture. 
Last week I decided I had it and I’m buying a new machine, I decided to go with semi Automatic but since i bought a machine 6 month ago I’m looking to stay in a reasonable price range.

I read a lot and it looks like the Barista Pro might be a good machine for my needs. The main complaint i saw is regarding the grinder. A few questions:
1. Is the machine overall a good buy? Does it make decent coffee?
2. If i decide later down the road to invest in a separate grinder, will i get better results from the machine? Other than the overall higher cost, is there any major downside to this approach?
3. Is there any machine in this price range that is significantly better than the BP?

I really don’t want to end up with another machine that makes disappointing coffee so I would appreciate any advice.

Coffee,I have a really nice grinder but never grind coffee because I hate the mess. Any tips?,"A few years ago, I was gifted a Baratza Virtuoso coffee grinder, and I imagined myself grinding coffee every day and treating it more like a hobby than just a daily drink. 

Unfortunately, I quickly got out of the habit because of the huge mess this thing makes. When I grind coffee, it flies everywhere. There's the actual heavy coffee grounds, but there is also a thinner material almost like sawdust that static clings the the little receptacle, and when I pull it out, the stuff flies everywhere. It also sticks to the inside of the machine.

I remember before I had this thing and I was looking into grinders, people mentioned getting one with a rubber receptacle to cut down on this problem. But this machine is way to nice to but another one.

Coffee,"Machine Search (Automatic, easy swap)","Hey friends.  I mostly brew with a Chemex and love my good coffee.  But I’ve gotten lazy as it’s getting colder and life-gets-complicated.  And I find myself really wanting the convenience of ‘push a button, coffee come out’ when I just want a cup.  Especially of decaf in the evening.  

I don’t want the extra cost of using a K-cup or pod machine (not the lack of quality).  Really I’d be looking at some kind of grind and brew. Or Super Automattic Espresso machine.  

But here is my catch that I can’t seem to find.  For one.  Would rather not spend $5k on an option.  (Honestly even the $500 cheap super automatic machines have me going hmmmmm ouch).  But more important is that I really want a way to switch beans for caffeine/decaf quickly.   And while brewing a whole pot is find at times.  Really just want the ability to make a single cup when I want it. 

Actual dual hopper machines I’ve found are in that $5k range.    So what other options exist?

I know I read some old threads about grind&amp;brew machines that had swappable hoppers that somehow didn’t spill.  So you could just keep different hoppers ready.   But I can’t find any info on machines that have that currently.

Coffee,Gift Ideas: DeLonghi EC685 (Pump Espresso) or Nespresso?,"Hi all, thanks in advance - my dad's birthday is coming up and I am thinking of getting him a better coffee machine and need some advice (my dad has only ever had instant and filter coffees😞). Sadly the place where he lives is not big on coffee culture, so coffee machine models are very limited - DeLonghi and Breville machines only, nothing fancy like Rancilio/Gaggia/Lelit/Sage machines. Nespresso subscription (not Vertuo, the small pods) is also an option. After looking into several websites + budget limitations, I've decided that I'll either get a:

1) **DeLonghi EC685 Dedica** (about $310 in local currency, the next best machine is a Philips EP-2220 at $740 and I don't really want to spend that much in case he doesn't like it), *or*

2) **Nespresso machine + subscription** (small pods, not Vertuo - similar price for a year subscription)

I've read a few posts and review articles about the DeLonghi EC685 and seems like the consensus is that the machine is not that great (flat tasting espresso, pressurised basket = bad, etc.). Nespresso should produce a more consistent brew, but I'm not too sure how good it tastes vs. a pump espresso machine. My question is, if you had to pick one, would you go for the DeLonghi EC685 or Nespresso? I would think either will be an upgrade vs. instant/filter coffee but would just like some advice on the better option, thanks!",1609116803

I would like to alleviate the cough as much as possible before I start to feel better, and tea is something my friends have suggested. 

The problem: I've hated tea my entire 28 years. I'm a generally annoying, picky person when it comes to drinks, but I would love to be a Tea Person. Even if I didn't have this cough, I still want to love tea. 

I'm so boring. I generally only drink water and Pink Drinks or Hot Mochas from Starbucks. I don't like intense flavors most of the time. I don't like my stepmom's iced sun tea, or the hot chai tea and iced black tea my friends have offered me. I definitely need sweetness, but trying a southern iced black tea from my friend was like drinking liquid sugar. 

Flavor likes: Strawberry, honey, lemon, mint, chocolate, walnut, hazelnut
Flavor dislikes: Intense flavors, flavors that feel like I'm drinking a lawn, Starbucks chai
* I would prefer hot teas, and for some reason a creamier (more coffee-like) thickness appeals to me

I know just trying different ones will help me lead to a tea I fall in love with, but I'm hung up on being worried I'll waste tea if I don't end up liking it. I hate wasting food or drinks, and I don't want to let my friends down with my pickiness.

I bought myself a mint chocolate tea last holiday season. It is the first and only tea I have ever bought for myself and if I put 3 spoons of milk and sugar in it... it's passable. But I still haven't finished even half the box which was probably only 20 or so tea... sachets(sp?). My only point being, I know literally nothing about tea (not even Arizonas, sweet or iced tea), so please go easy on me.

Regardless, I am trying to identify a tea to give as a gift to someone this holiday season. Earlier this year my friends and I went to Mitsuwa in New Jersey. For those who don't know Mitsuwa is a large Japanese supermarket with a food court and accompanying stores nearby. While I don't drink tea, I did go down the tea aisle with my friends and one of the things we noticed was a sign that had a simple graphic above the tea shelves explaining how caffeinated the various kinds of teas were. It listed a bunch between 1-5 stars (out of 5)... but then there was an outlier... One specific tea was listed at something like 11 out of 5. We eventually located the spot on the shelf for it, but it was sold out... So I don't even know what this looks like to give more information. I'd like to get this tea for one of my friends as a gift, even if it ends up being terrible tasting the memory of shopping together and this story will make a fine gift I think. If it comes down to it I'll just go there again, but if I can save myself the \~1 hour drive each way, not to mention it being potentially sold out again that would be awesome. 

So does anyone know what this tea is? Can it be bought online somewhere? Mitsuwa didn't have a complete inventory listed online so I don't think their website will be much help, but maybe someone will navigate it better than I did.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I know nothing about tea, but I saw a tea listed as 11/5 caffeine at a Mitsuwa in New Jersey a few months back and now want to get it as a gift for one of the friends I was with when we originally saw it. I don't know what it is, or even what the packaging looks like since it was sold out at the time.",1607441680

Coffee,Drawdown time unaffected by grind size?,"I have a bag of single origin Brazil from my local roaster, which Is really delicious when I can brew it right. I started with 16 clicks on my C2, and got about a 3:45 drawdown. It tasted over-extracted, which made sense, so I began gradually increasing grind size to compensate. 

On most beans, that would change the drawdown time, but not the case for this roast. I ended up at 22 clicks, which maintained a 3:45 drawdown and tasted great. Generally 22 clicks would get me under-extracted coffee, as the drawdown would be wayyy less than 3:45, but in this case it works. 

Is there any explanation as to why grind size would have no effect on drawdown time with this roast? I imagine it’s something to do with the coffee itself, as all the other factors (v60 filters, water temp, etc) don’t change between roasts.",1609111772
Coffee,Is my Wilfa Uniform supposed to be able to grind finer?,"Hi good folks of r/coffee,

I recently upped my coffee game and purchased an actual coffee grinder, having used a block burr grinder for the last few years.

I read that this grinder is supposed to be able to grind fine enough for espresso, slightly too fine according to some reviews, however, I've noted that some of the beans aren't that fine at all, but I put that down to inconsistency when I compared it to the inconsistent extra fines from a block burr.

Over Christmas, I was gifted some espresso ground, and I believe it's a good source, and found the ground to be much finer than even the finest setting on my Wilfa.

I want to check what people's opinions are, is there something wrong with my grinder or is the ground I was gifted too fine? I don't actually make espressos at home, but I want to know if my machine is a dud that needs looking into.

Coffee,Has anyone noticed that the same region of coffee begins to lose their flavor after a few months? [Discussion],"I began drinking Ethiopian coffee in September and so, I have been buying the same bag from the same supplier ever since. 


Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, my family wanted to try different region coffee and so, I bought my usual Ethiopian coffee and another Kenya coffee. Since we only open one bag at a time, we decided to try the new Kenya coffee beans. It tasted alright. 


Fast forward to this morning, we had finished the Kenya coffee and onto my usual Ethiopian coffee. I made my usual espresso with it and WOW! **The fruity flavors are so pronounced!!!**


I realized that the past few months of drinking from the same region/specialty coffee, I had grown accustomed to the flavor that I no longer noticed it; that is until I changed to drinking different coffee.

Coffee,Review: Cloth Filters for Aeropress,"Hi All! I am a long-time lurker and first-time poster.  I thought I would contribute my experience with a recent experiment as a beginner/lazy coffee enthusiast: using a cloth filter with my Aeropress! I will give a TLDR version below, as well as a more in-depth review.

**TLDR**: I loved it! I am already a huge Aeropress fan but found the paper filters too fine (they strained out all the beautiful oils), and I found the mesh strainer to be not fine enough (it made the coffee a little sooty). I was looking for the same flavor profile you might get using a Central American ""sock,"" and this gave it to me. 

**A Little Backstory**: I lived in Central America for several years and had the best coffee of my life while there. I bought the cheapest, pre-ground coffee at the local corner store, boiled some water, and poured it through a chorreador (which uses a long cloth that resembles a sock). Nothing I have found in the US, no matter how extravagant, has been able to beat the cheapest coffee I had there. 

In a never-ending search for the same cup of coffee, I have tried just about every method you can buy within reason (Nespresso, drip, Chemex, french press, and buying my own chorreador, which does come pretty close but is a bit of hassle and I could never get it quite right). The closest and easiest thing I found was the Aeropress.  The only downside to the Aeropress was the paper filters; in an effort to be greener and more thoughtful about my consumption, I searched for a permanent filter for the Aeropress. I found several mesh filters and decided to buy one. It worked...fine. But, I ended up switching back to paper because the mesh made the coffee a little sooty. After bouncing around between all my other coffee makers for about a year, it dawned on me that I should try to use a ""sock"" with the Aeropress. 

I searched and, sure enough, was able to find cloth filters for the Aeropress. I gave it a go this morning and finally felt like I had gotten the same coffee as I did when living abroad! It was super clean/drinkable, and I could see a little oil on top (which I love). I found this process to be very forgiving since I did not measure the water temp and only have the use of a blade grinder ATM. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. If you have any tips, please share! I am not sure why I cannot make the chorreador here work as well as it did overseas. My guess is I am using the wrong grind, or there is something different about the water. It certainly does not make bad coffee; it is just not quite as good as I remember (or maybe the flavor I am missing is actually just nostalgia)!",1609097711

Coffee,Espro P3 (550 ml / 18 oz) to big,"Hi! 

Got my Espro P3 as a Christmas gift, was supposed to be 550 ml / 18 oz. A perfect size for my 400 ml brew. But its actual size was more like 850 ml / 29 oz in total volume. Sounds like a luxury problem but I like to scoop the bitter tasting foam off after extraction, before pressing. Now I have the same problem reaching down to the coffee to scoop the foam off as I had with my 1000 ml / 34 oz Bodum. 

Can someone explain why they label it as 550 ml / 18 oz when it isn’t? Understand you can’t brew with 850 ml water but that is the total volume after all. And you can surely brew more than 550 ml at once...  Imo it would be labelled 850 ml. Any suggestions?

Coffee,Single cup pourover to complement aeropress,"Current setup consists of an oxo Burr grinder, variable temp gooseneck electric kettle, and aeropress. 

I don't usually bother with inverted recipes, but I have a couple methods that vary the time, temp and ratio that I play with depending on the beans I have at the moment, from the short, small extractions like the original aeropress recipe, to longer 2 1/2 ish minute 9-10 ounce brews.

Overall I'm very happy with the aeropress,but I'd like to have a single cup pourover to use as well. Something that would complement the aeropress. I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, and make one cup at a time, usually just 2 cups per day.

I know the v60 is popular, but it looks like it's designed to primarily brew multiple cups into a carafe? Is the Melitta wave the most popular single cup pourover?

Coffee,Bialetti brikka recipe,"I came across from a different forum their version of how they brew with their brikka 4 cup...  and I went ahead and tried it so the recipe involves

-18g of finely ground coffee (how you'd grind your espresso to be)
-Tamping it real hard. Yes you've read that right. Contrary to what many people would advice, the recipe calls for tamping the ground coffee.
-70g of cold water

I was very skeptical at first in trying this recipe as it involves tamping the coffee but man was I wrong, I liked how it produced less sour and more body to the coffee. The results were different from start to finish as the flow of coffee wasnt as fluid as not tamping it but nevertheless it still made a decent tasting coffee w/ milk.

Coffee,Getting started with espresso,"This Christmas I was kindly given an espresso machine. This is something I'd never expected and I'd never originally intended to make espresso at home. It's all extremely new to me and I feel both underprepared and underequipped to start making espresso. Does anyone have any advice for how to get started?

The thing I'm lacking is a good enough grinder. I currently use a Hario Skerton grinder, which surely wouldn't grind fine enough for espresso. The machine, however, has a pressurised portafilter. How would my coffee turn out if I used the finest grind possible with my current grinder? And how would it turn out if I bought pre-ground coffee from roasters or supermarkets?

Another thing I'm wondering about is dosage. How much coffee should I be using and how much water? I currently use kitchen scales (which have 0.1g accuracy) to measure out coffee for pourovers etc., but is it worth investing in some better scales?

I never had tea growing up other than chamomile (thanks to my Colombian family of coffee drinkers). So when I found that I liked some teas, I usually bought the bagged decaf kind. I’m also super sensitive to caffeine. My heart thumps wildly in my chest for hours at the thought of a large Diet Coke, let alone coffee or strong teas. 

Yesterday I went to a local tea shop and got two ounces of a delicious California Chai. I enjoyed every sip of it. But by the time I got to the bottom of the cup, I was ALIVE. Like straight up hopped up on that good stuff. I don’t mind it for a once in a while buzz- but I felt pretty crappy for a long while after.

I am drinking big cups of tea at once , 400ml ones. 

I drink st. jhons wort, lavendeer,  chamomile and linden tea.

So the way i make my team is that i brew around 3 baggies of st. jhons and 3 of lavendeer in 800ml of water, and thats 2 cups in the morning. Those 6 baggies i do them one more time for 1 cup in the evening before sleep.

Also i like to make my chamomile solo and i make it intense because it calms me alot, 2 big cups a day, sometimes 3. In the afternoon ill have 2 and maybe 1 in the morning and play around betwen chamomile and lavendeer and st. jhons.

And linden tea from time to time again intense style.

Oh yeah and ginger but since i dont have any more room for drinking, i decided to chew on some ginger from time to time, instant calm and relief.

Is it safe what im doing ? Mixing teas together ? And drinking such a variety every day ?

I have never felt more calm and stable and ballanced in my life, and so much positive emotion coming from these teas, i used to be a wreck of stress and anxiety and negative emotions so anything that relieves me of these and makes me balanced and stable and worry free and content im gonna have alot of that please. 

Oh yeah i also take some l theanine suplement  do to its relaxing effects and the great focus it provides. At least 800mg-1g a day.

I understan, I think, the work involved in each  (cleaning, etc, as I’ve read a lot of reviews) , except the higher level Breville. 

I’ve read some conflicting reviews of the actual expresso quality between Nespresso and a super automatic. 

What I’d love to hear is how you’d rate the quality of the espresso for each, say out of 10. 

I’d like something quicker during the workday, and a weekly clean would be fine, which is why I’d lean towards the super automatic. But, is it enough of a step up from the Nespresso in terms of the quality of the expresso produced to warrant the cost? Ignoring lifetime expense, how do they compare?

Neither of us have any experience in the art/science, but I have researched as much as I could absorb in the last 5 weeks in preparation. Now I'm hoping you can guide me in the right direction.

For starters, our new gear;

Baratza Virtuoso+ grinder
Clever Dripper
Aeropress
AICOOK gooseneck kettle 
A scale measurable to within 1 gram
Alto Cold Brew filters
Whole beans purchased from Happy Mug, to include 'Sophisticated Ethiopia' 'Strong &amp; Gentle Bear Blend' 'Rainy Day Blend' and 'Outdoorsy Sumatra'.

Having only used the Clever, here is our technique;

Wet the paper filter &gt; grind 15g beans on setting 22 &gt; heat water to 194°F &gt; pour 260g into the clever &gt; pour in grinds and gently stir to ensure all grinds are wet &gt; time for 2 minutes &gt; give one last stir &gt; wait 20 more seconds &gt; drawdown into cup &gt; exactly 2 Tbsp of Coffee Mate French Vanilla liquid creamer.

Q #1: Are we properly  utilizing the Clever? I'm kind of exhausted with information at this point, and would like some opinions. Lol. My wife &amp; I definitely do not like bitter coffee, but we also have loved every one of the beans we got from Happy Mug (probably because of the jump in quality alone).

Q #2: Any suggestions for use of the Aeropress?

Q #3: Should I continue to use Happy Mug, or are there better quality beans? I am near Cambridge, United Kingdom &amp; have yet to find a local place.

I'll start with one of my own mistakes: buying a ""beginner electric grinder"" instead of using the same amount of money, or a bit more, to purchase an excellent hand grinder. I would have saved myself a lot of undesirable results if I had started with a grinder that produced a more uniform grind size.

The dripper/pot weighs around 590 g, so even with 48 g of coffee and the 8 g the wet filter weighs, the Brewista should be able to handle it. Frequently, it does not: about a third of the time it freaks out around 700 ml and I end up having to eyeball the last part of my pour-over.  


I've already been in touch with Brewista and gotten a replacement scale (the previous one basically didn't work above 600 ml), so at this point I'd rather just get a different scale that I know can reliably handle brewing that much coffee.

Coffee,(UK folk) Grinder: Sage Dose Control Pro vs Baratza Encore,"I have been using a Chemex and French press for some time now with pre-ground beans and would like to start grinding my own.

I am looking to spend no more than £150, would prefer electric (but would consider a good manual if available in UK) and have narrowed down to the Sage Dose Control (currently £120 on Amazon, down from £160) and Baratza Encore (£150ish). The Sage Grinder Pro at £200 is out of my budget.

I know there has been previous posts on Breville/Sage vs Baratza but many of these are based in America. Baratza is comparably more expensive in GBP and a lot of the American reviews and commenters cite Baratza’s customer support as a good reason to opt for the Encore but not sure this is as valid in the UK. However I also don’t know how Sage’s support compares.

I switch it off and then on again and it doesn't turn on. My wife empties the beans out of the hopper and managed to turn it on. She put beans back in the hopper and then it wouldn't turn on at all. That's still the case with or without beans.

I've taken the cover off and poked at it with a multimeter. There's no continuity across the motor, and no reading from the windings to the motor casing. 

I've tried plugging it into a kill-a-watt and the outlet voltage is about 120v(123, I think when I checked) which is what I'd expect. However, the amperage reading is 0.

Coffee,v60 &amp; Aergrind problems,"Hey,

I got my Aergrind in early 2018, later a Baratza Encore. I only did mocca pots and Aeropress with it, but now I got into pour-over brewing with a V60, where I ran into some problems. I am using the Hoffmann method and started out relatively coarse, but the brew was too light/hollow/acidic, so I dialed down more and more. Until I hit very long draw-down times (4:30, coarser grinds 3:15). And while yes, the coffee got more intense, it also got more bitter - which now is either due to my brewing skills or to the grind-consistency. The brew bed and filter walls to me look pretty muddy with both grinders and I can't make out a big difference in taste for both grinders (though I haven't done a direct comparison yet - something I should probably try next(?). I looked at potential problems with the Aergrind and found out about the wobbling issues that Aergrind has and also that mine suffered from that as well a bit.

  
Since I don't have anything to compare to besides my Encore, could you tell me, if the grounds from the Aergrind are expected to look like this? From what I can see by eye, it appears to me, that the Aergrind produces a few really large boulders and a bit more fines.

If the grind-consistency is the issue, I would probably either upgrade the burr set in the encore or buy a new handgrinder (I am thinking about the 1zpresso JX-Pro). Do you think that would solve my issues or is the problem elsewhere (like in my brewing skills)?

Does pouring too quickly or too slowly lead to bitterness? Should I wait less/more time inbetween pours (I usually wait until the coffee goes from a consistent stream to a drip to start the next pours after waiting 30 seconds for the bloom)?

I thought about using less coffee but boy do they seem consistent on those weights for blended coffee.

And here's the funny part: I'm a new coffee ""snob"", so I don't even know if this is really what it's SUPPOSED to taste like. I don't see how, though. Just seems particularly bitter and not as enjoyable as when I brew with my siphon coffee maker.",1608995581

Coffee,Sage / Breville Machines,"I’ve long been a filter only person as I don’t really like Espresso. But I do like Milk espresso based drinks - flat white and so on.

In my coffee corner I’ve always gone down the filter route and have a Moccamaster, Clever, v60 on my work top.

But in the UK, people drink lattes but rarely will someone have straight black filter. So I have a machine for me only. I’d like people to enjoy coffee too in my house, we have instant in my cupboard for guests and it keeps me awake at night! (Might be a stretch) 

So I have been shopping for a machine to do espresso based drinks (without going down the hole of espresso financial ruin) so there was a deal on today on Amazon for the sage barista express for £399 - so I jumped at that and snapped it up.

I know the barista pro is faster heat up and has more variable grinder - But hopefully if I am going only milk based - the nuances won’t affect me that much.

I don’t think that paying an extra £300 for the barista pro was worth it. I don’t need a 3 second start up! I wouldn’t make v60s - if I was in a rush!!

So, basically - will that machine suit my need!? As it is - A fairly decent mid-range espresso machine to do decent lattes and flat whites?! 

I have another grinder - Wilfa uniform, but this is primarily a filter grinder and I don’t think it would work well for espresso as it’s only 40 steps.

Coffee,Home roasting- cost saving or hobby?(warnjng-stupid questions),"I was doing some maths on how much fresh coffee would cost me per year. I have a local ish roaster I ordered from and it's $16 shipped. A 12oz bag lasts me 2 weeks.thats $416/year. Exploring roast your own option has yielded some interesting results.

Now there's no doubt that the cost of the beans is cheaper green. Until you add in shipping. On many sites I've searched I've seen shipping cost 1.5x what the coffee costs(for 1 pound), bringing little savings over my local roaster. But since green beans store for longer, and  are done in full pounds rather than 12oz increments, the cost per oz will be lower. But not much, since there is evaporate loss in the roasting process).

It should be obvious that the pound of green beans can be of noticeably higher quality, and give me the ability to custom tune it.

Even Amazon sells green beans, with free shipping fulfilled by Amazon. But I worked maintenance at a warehouse in my younger days, and I have no faith in the freshness or storage conditions of green beans in a warehouse(that doesn't specialize in coffee). Would be cheap though, and I've been wrong before, I'm sure I will be again.

The roaster I'm looking at is the fresh roast sr800. I can get an sr540 and upgrade the glass to roast up to 8oz, or I could just get one that does 8oz for about the same cost(which is also upgradable). I'm pretty well versed in the pros and cons of these models, and the mods fot these. Yo me it seems like the most affordable way to roast 6 to 8oz with a decent balance if control, efficiency,  and automation(meaning I don't want to crank it stirr, don't want it taking a half hour, but have no problem pushing buttons every couple minutes).

Anyways, wouldn't mind hearing some feedback from the home roasters out there, see what I missed in my assessment, and where others stand on the quality/price fence.

Coffee,First time using a Moka pot,"Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you all first of all. I received an aluminium Moka pot for Christmas and wanted to get down to business using it. Before I did I wanted to know if it's safe to use a mild dish soap? I know the manual says not to but I can't help finding it a bit gross that I can't use proper soap to sterilise it and keep it sanitary. 

For people who own the aluminium version, how did you clean it and season it?",1608980118

Now, using the correct temps has brought some fruity magic to my cup, that I hadn’t tasted in these beans before.

Coffee,Sage Barista express - Amazon,"Hi everyone,

Amazon have a boxing day sale on today and the sage barista express is on sale from 600 to 400 pounds. I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this machine? I have barista expierence of a year (it was a few years ago) so dopn't need something to hold my hand.

My current grinder doesn't grind fine enough for espresso hence why i'm looking at the paring.

The only bad point i seem to find about the machine is the fact it heats milk rather slowly which is fine i don't need it to be or expect it to be as quick as a commercial machine or more expensive domestic machine/

Let me know your thoughts,

tea,I'm a bit lost need some help and treasure Green tea company.,"So after stopping in this sub to figure out how to brew my tea bags better and about a week of lurking later, I'm ready to go all in on Chinese style brewing. Initially I had a whole order on yuinns sourcing redy but with the shipping costing me over $200  I decided to try and find somewhere domestic in Canada to get everything. I was looking for a website that's a one stop shop, somewhere I could get aesthetically pleasing tea ware as well as quality tea.

I found way down in the side bar a Canadian shop https://treasuregreen.com they have all the tea ware selection I am looking for but it is pretty expensive, with some of it being insanely expensive. I'm not sure if they just stock really nice stuff or they charge to much. Now where I am truly lost is selecting tea from them, I have no idea what I'm looking for or what's quality and what's not. I mostly right now drink black tea, Earl Gray and chi. I basically want to try some quality black tea, green tea, oolong and pu-erh. I want to try all the main categories of tea and start developing and figuring out what I truly like.

Does anybody have any experience buying with treasure green? Or could help me out with selection from them?  I know there are probably better places to order from in the sidebar but I want all of this to arrive before my family comes down at Christmas. I've looked at so many of the sellers in the sidebar and other than Yuinns this place seems to have a great selection of tea ware and tea compared to others.

tea,Does decaffeinated tea tend to have noticeable flavor differences compared to its normal counterpart?,"Does decaffeinated tea tend to have noticeable flavor differences compared to its normal counterpart? Curious with regards to both tea bag brands and loose leaf varieties. I'm a coffee drinker too so I would like to reduce my caffeine intake. Actually, I drink tea and coffee both purely for flavors and prefer neither to have caffeine if given the choice, but for coffee this isn't really realistic without sacrificing quality.

Curious if anyone noticed the difference between decaffeinated tea and their unaltered counterparts in general. I realize the decaffeinating process does strip the tea some of its health benefits and inevitably affects the tea flavors at the chemistry-level but curious if anyone actually notices these nuisances in e.g. the versions of a tea bag brand where i assume the flavors are already ""brought down to a common denominator"" from the processing vs. loose leaf alternative.",1607183168

I took my first stab at growing camellia sinensis this year. I've encountered a few issues and was hoping you all could help me out. The plants were growing well throughout most of summer but sometime around mid-August yellow leaves began appearing along with brown spots on the healthy leaves. I have tried searching all over for the cause, but I can't find anything like what is happening to my plants. Once a brown spot appears, it spreads and the leaf eventually falls off. New, healthy leaves are still growing while this is happening. 

The plants are potted in miracle grow fast draining soil with just a bit of Dr. Earth acid loves mixed in. I have not fertilized or added anything since they were planted in spring. To help with soil draining I added some stones in the bottom of the pot prior to putting the soil in. I water them about once a week, making sure the soil is somewhat dry before watering again. They were outside all summer, but I have brought them inside recently for winter. The problems started prior to bringing them inside.

tea,Can Lapsang Souchong effect your asthma?,"I recently discovered lapsang souchong and it was not love at first sight. My father in law ordered some because he remembered drinking it in his youth once or twice. He wanted me to try it but after smelling it I refused adamantly. He continued to try to get me to have a cup  over the next few visits (he admitted that he hated the taste himself) and when I finally agreed to try it his eyes lit up anticipating my horror and digust. 

Much to his chagrin  I loved it. Smoky, peaty, sweet and warm. It was heaven in a glass and I have not looked back. Every morning since ( he unloaded all his tea on me)  I have drank a cup of lapsang souchong to start my day and I am losing enthusiasm for coffee.

However, my asthma has been acting up and I can't figure out why. Suddenly it hit me that perhaps the lapsang souchong was culprit. Although I think my asthma has been acting up a little before my first cup.

I desperately want this not to be the case, because I am in love with this tea. I have even ordered more varieties off the internet. 

A quick Google didn't bring anything up and I don't have a doctors appointment until Thursday , so I am putting it out to r/tea hoping that there are some lapsang souchong lovers with antecedotal evidence on the subject or a tea expert who can enlighten me.

tea,Advice: Best Lapsang souchong // Zhengshan Xiaozhong,"Hello!

I've been drinking Lapsang souchong for many years.

The last few years I've noticed that different Lapsang from different shops can vary a lot.

I like them real tarry/smoky, but some Lapsang mostly resembles plain black tea(!!)

I am sure there's variety with different blends/brands and that's fine, but I haven't had a really satisfactory cup of ""bog water"" for years and that's *not* fine! =-(

Even my last order I had from the shop that used to serve me real good lapsang was dissappointing.

Is this because:

1. I am less sensitive to the smoky quality of the tea?
2. It could be a different brand or just older tea (because it's a small local shop)?

I really hope it's not option 1! =-D  

I doubt you can answer that, but can you answering me on:  


Is lapsang suspectible to long or bad storage? I am inclined to assume the smoky aroma is volatile.

  
If I want to find the smokiest/tarriest Lapsang, I have to try international tea shops, right? (tea bought locally in my small country can be old).  
I've avoided buying from international shops as transport fees to Norway can be really expensive. It might be something I'll have to try, though, and maybe try 2+ different brands simultanously, as side-by-side comparison may be the best way to compare brands. 

Is lapsang in satchets (""bags"") fine, or should it be loose tea in an air tight box?  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


All these questions and wall of rambling! So sorry!  


TL;DR:  Me want good, smoky Lapsang. What or where to look for?  ^(Thanks!)",1607089342

tea,Just ordered my first brick of Sheng Pu-Erh and Ive got some questions,"The past few months I've been browsing the internet, primarily looking at teas and incenses. Just a little while ago I was looking around on the Harney and Sons website, as I was ordering a new tin of CTC Assam (one of my favorites) and I came across a tea called something along the lines of 2007 Sheng Pu-Erh, something I hadnt ever heard of before. It seemed interesting so i clicked on it. And then the image came up and I realized that, it was a tea i had before, and I remember absolutely loving it. So at this point I knew i had to get some.

After some research I figured out that what I probably had unknowingly been drinking was an aged variety of Pu-Erh, so I began looking at those. 

I found a 1.5oz brick of Mid-90s Pu-Erh on Livingteas, I read the description and it just felt right as to what i was trying for. So after some careful deliberation between a few different vendors and teas I went with that one. 

Now, my questions are as follows

I was more than likely brewing the tea I had a few years ago quite wrong (Full boiling water, 4-6 min steep time)
What can I do to make my experience with it better this time around?

How long should a brick of this size last? 

How should I store it? 
I remember the previous brick I had began to get *extremely* dry and brittle after about a month of having it. If you are wondering how I acquired it without knowing it was Pu-Erh, I was at a friends house whilst having tea and they mentioned they had a ""brick"" of tea they wanted me to try (which confused me at the time, i didnt know tea could come in a brick), which was the Pu-Erh, after I had tried it I told them that I very much enjoyed it and they took about a 0.5oz piece off of what they had (would estimate around 2.5 oz is the size they had). I had just had it stored in a ziploc bag in a cupboard.

Coffee,Underextraction issues - Grind size or method too?,"Hello!

I have a theory that my old bladed electric grinder is not grounding coffee beans consistently enough. When I attempt a medium grind size I end up with medium and coarser particles, so I plan to upgrade my grinder in the very near future. But would this be the only contributing factor to underextracted coffee?

I have been using local medium roasts with a Bodum pour over (with the default mesh filter). I use a gooseneck electric kettle and bloom once the water has been off-boil for about 30 seconds. But my extraction time feels low - like only a couple of minutes. 

The results are tolerable but I just don't think it's getting to the proper level of extraction. 
I like a cleaner cup and don't think the Bodum filter is very good for that, unfortunately paper just collapses in it as some of you may know. Even with a straw in there for air.

So a couple questions - any recommendations on a new grinder? Currently looking at a Cusinart Burr Mill. I also wonder if it would be worth it to upgrade my pour over to a system where I can use a paper filter if I can't make the Bodum work for me?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",1608950994

Right now I have a Baratza Virtuoso as our grinder. I know it’s not made for espresso grinding, but we do a lot of drip grinds, and on occasion a cold brew coarse grind in our household. However, I was looking for a machine that could potentially be the “Swiss Army Knife” of grinding coffee. Looking into it, I came across the Sette 270Wi. On Baratza’s site it said it can dial in espresso grind and also grind “any style of coffee”. From anyone’s personal experience, is this relatively true? Does anyone possibly have another recommendation of a different grinder? I love Baratza’s products and their customer support has been nothing but stellar. I’d love to stick with them if possible but open to hearing other recommendations.",1608948076

Coffee,How much caffeine is in Turkish Coffee?,"I got a Turkish coffee maker for Christmas and followed the recipe on the back -two heaping teaspoons of coffee to 70 ml water. I've never had it before so I wasn't sure how to make or drink it. and I drank the whole thing and most of the grounds. I was having trouble with the stove so I while I got the coffee to foam the first time it started to boil, the subsequent times I brought it to a boil the coffee didn't really foam it just kept boiling.

&amp;#x200B;

An hour later I think I was close to having a panic attack, even though I've never come close to having one before. Was it because of the caffeine? I was a barista before the pandemic so I can really handle my caffeine, it was not uncommon for me to handle 6 or 7 shots of Espresso with no huge problem besides feeling kind of tense , but I have cut back to a 12 oz french press and a couple cups of green tea a day in the past several months. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like Espro has a cult around it and I am considering to get P7 in 0.55 liter size. Usually I make my cup something between 120 ml to 160 ml. Can I use that Espro from one cup?

&amp;#x200B;

In general, is Espro a recommendation?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot and I wish you a great weekend ahead!",1608899342

Coffee,What's my best option for a single cup brew?,"I live alone, and over the years, I've accumulated a few different methods of coffee making equipment:

1) A Bonavita drip machine

2) A Bodum French Press (not Biden French Press as bad as autocorrect wants it to be)

3) And a Chemex

I used to LIVE in coffee shops, and got most of my black coffee fix there, but given the pandemic, I've made my own coffee almost every day, and I have not been economical about it.

Basically, I've been using the Bonavita drip machine every day, and I love the coffee it makes, but the way I measure it causes a lot of waste for a few reasons.

First of all, I drink my coffee out of a thermos, even at home. When I use a mug, it gets cold too quickly, and I drink it slowly over a long period of time.

The perfect balance I've found for the Bonavita is 3 coffee scoops worth of ground coffee and the water tank filled up to ""4,"" whatever that arbitrary unit of measurement is. I remember reading somewhere a couple years ago when I got this machine that you shouldn't fill it much less than that, and although I don't know what the reason is, I've always been paranoid about it.

This is about two thermoses worth of coffee, and I only ever use one since it lasts me so long. But the time I want another cup, it's cold it both places. Which means every time I make a cup of coffee, I also waste one.

Of the three methods I own, what is the best way to make a single cup at a time? Can I just half my measurements for the Bonavita? Put in a scoop and a half of coffee and fill it to 2? I can't seem to find where I read that you shouldn't do that.

I'm leaving toward the French Press, since my problem with it was always that the leftovers got cold too fast. But if I'm just making a cup at a time, it doesn't matter. 

Thoughts? And Merry Christmas!",1608869310

How can i try a top of the line coffee in r/coffee's opinion without spending money on all the crazy shit you guys use? Is there something to look for in a coffee shop i could simply buy one? is there a one-time thing i could do with the usual kitchenware / one-time purchase of grounds or beans/company that would at least put me in the general ""this is what amazing coffee is like"" category?  


Honestly, i got a Keurig for xmas and i love it, but i see a lot of hate for them on this sub, and generally, if i feel something is worth being a connoisseur for, i go all out. Just looking to see if its worth it TO ME to get into coffee beyond the average addiction.

The comparison video on Seattle's YouTube for all the eureka grinders basically says that the only difference between the two models is the timer but now I'm reading some reviews that say the Crono has a better range for espresso.  So which is it?  Are they the same besides the timer or not?

I already have a super jolly for espresso so I'm just looking for a great grinder for filter and an occasional FP.  Did I order the wrong grinder?  Does anyone have first hand experience with the crono?

Coffee,Can't get my CHEMEX right,"Hey, so let me go over the equipment first

Chemex, 6 cup version

Chemex original square filters 

1zpresso JX-pro grinder

Scale that measures 0-2000g (xx,x) and timer

Kettle (no gooseneck) with temperature settings, even though it doesn't have a gooseneck I can have a pretty controlled flow due to the spout being rather pointy on my kettle.

Looking at the chart and what I have found online a grind about 28 rotations on my grinder should be pretty good for pour overs. I think that is very fine and tried to grind coarser, I have even tried around 40 rotations and even then I had a 7-8min brew time for 30grams of coffee and 500g of water.

I do not understand what I am doing wrong.

I follow the James Hoffman V60 method which is functional for the chemex as well.

I even tried a 18g/300g brew and figured it would have some sort of impact but the brew time was still 6-7minutes and did not taste good.

The first day when I bought it I had a pretty good cup but I took the filter out at the 4:30minute mark even though it still had 50-75g of water in it. Do I have the wrong grinder for this? What am I doing wrong?

Coffee,Question about Pour Overs,"Short question:
How does one keep their pour over coffee hot?


Back story:
I freshly boil water in a steel kettle when I make pour overs. 

Next, I pour the water slowly and soak as much bean as I can without drowning it. So as one could imagine, I have time to put the steel kettle down while the pour over drips. 

When I put the kettle down, I put it back on the stove in an effort to keep the water hot. However, even with this tactic my pour over coffee still comes out colder than I would hope. When I finish adding my creamer (granted it does come straight from the fridge), my coffee is luke warm or colder at best. What should I do to keep my pour overs hot?",1608847161

**White teas tend to be pleasant and interesting, approachable, not astringent at all, and either quite subtle or else possessing good sweetness and intensity, and floral and fruit flavor. Aged versions can pick up deeper dried fruit or warm spice flavors.**

**White tea is considered to be one of the main categories of teas. Those groupings also include black tea (also called red, based on a Chinese-language convention), green, oolong, dark (hei cha, with pu’er typically grouped as this type), and yellow (which can also be left off as a main type, for being more rare).**

**Processing steps determines these tea types, not other factors (plant type, region source, oxidation level, etc.)...**

I recently got a new tea pot and I'm having an issue where every time I re-steep my tea in the pot, it comes out bitter, and I'm not sure what's causing it. For years I've never had a tea pot, I've just steeped my tea in one cup and poured it through a strainer into another cup, and I've never had any issues with bitterness unless I accidentally made the water too hot or let it steep too long. I generally use about the same temperature and steeping time for re-steeps as I do for the first steep. When I use the tea pot, the first steep comes out perfect, but any subsequent steeps are bitter. I thought maybe the water wasn't all draining out after the first steep, but it doesn't look like there's any more water left than when I used my previous method. I even tried rinsing the leaves with cold water before steeping again, which seems like it helped a bit, but it was still bitter. Any idea what's going on??",1606935066

tea,Help with brewing black tea properly? (Western Style),"I tried brewing Jin Jun Mei and Earl Grey earlier. I'm mostly used to brewing green tea and light oolong teas so I'm still adjusting to black tea. They taste ok but not as strong as I hoped. Something is wrong when a Longjing has a stronger taste than a Jin Jun Mei. Or it could be the quality of the leaves. The black teas I bought weren't too expensive

Here are my brewing parameters: 

&amp;#x200B;

Loose-leaf to water ratio: 2g per 6oz. I've used this ratio for other teas such as Longing, Jasmine Tea, and Tieguanyin and it seems to work out very well. This is also falls within the recommended amount of leaves for western brewing (2-3g per 6-8oz)

Temperature: 90°C. I don't like the dark tasting notes. I also have a low tolerance for astringency and bitterness in my tea

Steeping Time: 3 mins. I've read that black teas can be steeped for 3-5 mins. I usually don't mess around with steep time in order to avoid bitterness and astringency. I tend to play it safe by steeping it at the minimum recommended time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Coffee,My ode to coffee,"Mods please feel free to delete if this isn't cogent. 


I've kind of always been a coffee snob. I find joy in experiencing different roasts and methods when I travel. I grew up on espresso and drip coffee, tiny (too small to be drinking coffee surely) fists dunking wine biscuits in the pitch black mug. It wasn't until I lived in Australia that I discovered third wave coffee. Third wave being the post-Starbucks wave, local coffee made more manually. Tasmania is rife with cafes and they all seemed to be stocked wall to wall with siphon brewers, pour over kettles, and very light roasts. (Did you know light roast has more caffeine?!) 

I visited the Blue Mountain Coffee farm in Jamaica to witness some roasting. Some of the most famous coffee in the world, roasted hours before I drank it on the side of a mountain: pure bliss. When I lived in Kenya I made a brief departure from coffee for the other warm beverage, tea, to visit a tea farm. Not for long though, as I lived with another coffee snob and we had brought with us travel coffee presses and scales. Kenya is also famous for it's coffee, although most of it is exported. Briefly I worked for a roasting company in their cafe here in Massachusetts (Barrington, they're a good company and I recommend them tenfold.)

I've delved deep into the mire of nerd coffee brewing. How many dissolved solids are in my espresso? How can I ensure even extraction? I now have about six different ways to make coffee at home, and in quarantine this has been nothing short of a blessing. It's a passion that encourages you to stay inside, to curl up with something warm. It provides a routine, a structure. You will wake up, you will boil water, you will hear the whir of the grinder. It's no secret that my kitchen has become my happy place, but my love of food began with a love of coffee. Learning to taste, learning to change on variable at a time when brewing, learning to try new things from different parts of the world. Discovering fair trade systems, transparent production lines, in my world that all began with coffee.

It has been very hard to be grateful. I don't feel my best and I'm not keen on pretending I do. I miss traveling, and in fact feel a significant fear that all my adventures might be behind me. But there are small, steady stalwarts that bring me peace everyday. That make me feel in control. That provide a moment of solace, and for me that's coffee.",1608827827

I have actually never made pour over myself and i basically experimented before buying equipment. I do like pourover by others or in cafés. So i poured water, and omg that was the most beautiful red colour ive ever seen coffee be, almost like red wine. At first i thought i made it wrong. Turns out, its THE most flavourful coffee I've ever made. Im amazed that the fruity notes, which i never really got with french press or moka pot, were much more pronounced. Now i finally get what you mean by saying ""blueberry notes""

Coffee,Flair Espresso Machine and Brew Ratios,"I just got myself a manual Flair Espresso machine (the pro) and have been playing with it a lot over the last couple of days.  I'm really enjoying it, even though I'm totally new to espresso, but I had a question about brew ratios using the device.  I'm hoping someone with more experience can set me straight:

Everything I've read says that espresso ratios should be around 1:1.5 to 1:2.5, which would mean that my rough target for output should be around 36 grams of espresso (assuming 18 grams of grinds).   
 But the Flair uses a chamber that the company says MUST be filled completely, which outputs exactly 60 grams-- WAY off target.  I'm guessing this is technically a ""lungo,"" and while I really like the taste, I was hoping to make some traditional espresso.

Should I just be cutting the shot short?  Like, is it ok to just stop pulling the lever halfway through, even though the chamber is still full of water?  Or should I just stick with the lungo and accept that this a quirk of the design?

Coffee,The noob chronicles-moka pot day 2 merry christmas!,"Having learned a few lessons from day 1, day 2 turned out to be a step in the right direction

The beans: I was gifted some vermont artesian coffee beans, a medium roast from a friend with a subscription. Ipanema is the name if i can read the sharpie on the small paper bag.

The grind: I changed the grind size dramatically from my first round. I was at #17 on my c2, and i ended up at #10. Of course grind settings are nowhere near universal, and my grind settings are only comparable to my previous settings on my grinder.

The brew: I filled up my hopper same as last time(going off the hoffman method and every other video i watched, the preferred method is to fill the hopper. I may change that in the future, as some have said ratios are a better way, but for now i will leave that variable out of it.) i used the same hot water from the keurig in the bottom and used slightly over medium setting on my electric stove. It took about 5 to 6 minutes to brew(6 cup). However, i did notice a few problems along the way.

Problem: Water boiled in the base at least 30 seconds before the brew started. This worried me, so with safety squints engaged, i kept an eye on the pressure valve(just kidding, do not point any safety valve at any part of your body ever. EVER. No joke, a discharge from any safety valve has the ability to mess you up)

Problem: The brew started coming out the top, and then stopped for a good bit, maybe 10 seconds.

(possible) problem: My electric glass top(non induction) stove pulses power, and it seems the time in between pulses might be too long. I can hear the water roll a boil, then slow down to a simmer, then roll a boil as the power pulses. This may affect the brew.

Problem: I did not get as high of a yield out of this batch. I cannot give exact numbers, but the volume was only about 75% of the last batch.

The result: The coffee had noticeable bitterness. Not insane, but noticeable. I will chalk this up as a big win. I have now developed 2 points of data on my grind, with #17 being noticeably too fine and #10 being slightly too coarse(based on flavor). 

The autopsy: This was very interesting. The basket had a rather compressed puck of grounds. They were relatively dry and felt like...polymer sand(yea, you probably have never felt polymer sand, but thats the feel). Like a sponge. See photo

Another interesting note for me is that the moka pot compresses the grounds slightly as it is screwed in. I did not notice that the last time around, and it really has no effect on my brew since i am using the hoffman technique, but for some reason i thought the mating surfaces are flat.

Conclusion: My brew was too fine. This led to my moka pot choking slightly. As the grounds expanded it caused a buildup in pressure, which converted the remaining water in the base to steam, resulting in a smaller yield. That was at a #10 grind, i will try a #12 grind next time.

As far as the flavor profile of the coffee goes, ive never had it before, but it has a cranberry muffin flavor to it. Definitely interesting, not my preferred morning flavors, but still one of the most...pleasant flavors i think ive had in coffee(dont forget, i have no standards in coffee).

As usual, i reserve the right to be wrong, and feel free to critique.

Merry christmas all. This year has been hell for all of us, but it is times like this that we need to appreciate all we have, and remember the things we had.",1608810300
Coffee,Moka pot - preboiling technique I use,"I used to preboil water in kettle, before pouring it in Moka pot, but few months ago, an idea came to me.

I fill the lower part of Moka pot (heating vessel) up to valve (standard volume) and put the vessel alone on gas stove.

After water starts boiling, I take it off gas, screw the rest of Moka pot on, and return it to stove. It's very hot, so ofc I use cooking gloves to handle the hot parts.

&amp;#x200B;

This way, I don't use 2 dishes, but only Moka pot, and I don't get bitter coffee, just as I have used separate kettle.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a nice routine, where I grind the coffee in manual grinder While water is heating in the heating vessel. And it takes about the same time to grind coffee for my 2 cup Moka pot as it takes for boiling the water. Nice, fast and easy.

Coffee,Aeropress sweetness troubleshooting,"I have some subscription beans from Tim Wendelboe, but I can't for the life of me get the tasting notes or really any sweetness from the coffee using my aeropress. Even as I adjust my grind click by click, the coffee either comes out too sour or too bitter, either way the sweetness or fruity notes aren't really present.

I use a 1zpresso Q2 grinder (medium grind) and the Aeropress in the normal position (not inverted). 90C water and 90s brew time with 3 stirs at the start and at the end.  

Is it something wrong with my Aeropress method? Or are the beans too stale (roasted 3 weeks ago, though the bags I think are nitrogen flushed)? I don't seem to have this problem with my other locally-roasted beans (also 3 weeks old).",1608807033
Coffee,Getting underwhelming results with Sage / Breville Precision Brewer. Any tips?,"I recently upgraded from an Aeropress where I was doing the inverted method. Have tried about 10 different cups with this brewer and it's still not producing great tasting coffee.

I typically brew 18g and 300ml for the 16.667 ratio.

I've tried:  
* The Gold setting (set by Specialty Coffee Association (SCA)) - that came out super fast and under-extracted, watery, thin
* Finer and coarser grinds - have settled on a medium/coarse as per the instructions
* Custom My Brew settings to try to slow the drip down, longer bloom time, etc.

I'm also noticing the shower head is quite small and it just dumps water in the middle, which is making me think I should really be brewing larger batches so it goes more slowly?

If anyone has run into issues with under-extraction in this thing, and has some recommended settings or tips they'd be really appreciated.

Coffee,Just got a pebble in my grinder.,"Got a new bag of coffe in the morning. Opened it up, filled my moka pot basket with beans (for measurement), emptied it in the Lido 3 grinder.

Turned the grinder upside down and emptied whatever was inside. A perfect, coffe bean looking pebble occurs. Panicked, took the pebble out, grinded the rest of the coffe, brewed it and drinked it just now. Too scared to open it up and check the burrs.

Coffee,Upgrading,"I went many years not drinking coffee.  My preferred breakfast was a king-sized Three Musketeers and a 16 oz Mountain Dew.  When I got to work, I could walk right across the ceiling, upside down...

Well, several years ago my wife hooked me on ""coffee"".

Currently we use a Bodum Antigua grinder, and usually Dunkin' Donuts coffee beans from the local grocery store.  I set the grind about halfway between fine &amp; coarse and then we brew it in a Mr Coffee machine.  Usually 10 cups of water and 2 1/2 - 3 scoops from a ""paramountcoffee.com"" scoop.  This gives a black liquid that can be consumed with a sweet flavored creamer, but I'd like to try my coffee black, and this just doesn't work.

I'm thinking my upgrade path is first to an Aeropress, then a better grinder as the Antigua doesn't give a consistent grind.  It's - how I read in another post - was it sand &amp; rocks?

Coffee,Developing the taste for coffee - A novice seeking advice,"Hi! I'm Yush, a 21-year-old from India. 

So I've been having coffee since I was around 10, thanks to my mother who loves it. However,  that 'coffee' is boiling milk poured over sugar and instant coffee whisked together with a teaspoon of hot water. 

Despite this traditional coffee being my go-to for many many years, my love of visiting cute cafes and enjoying great drinks over there has made me appreciate coffee much better than I ever did. 

With the aim to make myself a good cup of coffee in its truest sense, I've begun my journey of understanding coffee only recently. I've been reading a few blogs and watching (way too many) James Hoffman videos, but it's a difficult transition. 

I don't have any fancy equipment and the plethora of types of equipment available these days makes the choice difficult and daunting. I want to be as well informed as I can be, before making an investment. 

Here's what my journey has been so far. 

First stint. Near-boiling water. Instant coffee. No sugar.   
Tasted disgusting. (Davidoff Rich Aroma - If anyone's interested) Not sure if it was because I'd never had 'black coffee' before or because it was instant coffee and it wasn't meant to be had that way. 

Second stint. Ordered a Medium Roast ground coffee from a local roastery called Blue Tokai.   
It was a 'channi grind' that is, it was ground especially for filtering via a metal sieve. Added the grounds to near-boiling water, sieved it and took a sip. Better than before, but tasted much better with a little milk and sugar.  

Third but not so different stint. Tried the Starbucks Blonde Espresso roast.   
Used a filter over my metal sieve. Tried blooming it. (Such a glorious aroma, might I add) No sugar. No milk. Tasted it. Liked it. But by the end of the cup, it was too intense for me to finish. 

Now, I know I'm most likely all over the place and doing a TON of things wrong. But this process, despite being a not-so-good tasting one so far, has given me joy. And I need your help to make the journey of reaching a coffee, a better one. 

Genuinely appreciate ANY tip that you have for me. Just shoot! I'll definitely try and implement them. 

And specifically,  
\- The coffee. Medium roast or dark roast? What to start with? Which one is the best for how I'm making my coffee right now? 

\- Equipment. When should I switch? What should I switch to? Or should I stick with this till I get it right and then move on to more complicated things?

\- Taste Transition. Should I start with having my coffee with sugar? Or should stick it out and get used to it? 

Thank you so much, kind souls. Help me not have an extremely acidic &amp; bitter coffee ever again!",1608761834

Coffee,Moka Pot Steam Valve,"The actual 800-some member Moka Pot group seems to have died, so I am posting this here.

For about 12 years I used a stainless steel Bialetti 6 cup Moka pot. Over the last couple of years, it just became trickier and trickier to get a good brew. The main issue was the steam was shooting out of valve, and coffee not percolating up into the top. My work around was to hold a spoon in front of the valve to force the pressure build up and subsequently force the coffee up. I moved to a coarser grind and was somewhat able to mitigate this, but it was still hit or miss. 

Consulting Reddit, as one does, there were a lot of what I'll call  ""cleaning hounds"" trying to claim that there was build up and scaling in the basket and filter causing this issue. Except that there wasn't a build up or clogging of anything. But the cleaning hounds insisted. So I tried cleaning the hell out my Moka Pot using all of the dorky suggestions I was given. I even tried the plumbing tape around the basket, as demonstrated by someone on YouTube, in an effort to stabilize the action happening inside. Didn't work either. There were also the grind hounds who swore that a moka pot needs a coarser grind than what is generally accepted as a moka pot grind. If you go to Italy, everyone uses these things, and everyone buys pre-ground ""moka powder"". It works fine. You can buy the same exact coffee in the USA. Lavazza even puts a moka pot on their package. So, I refused to believe that I had to zero in on some super specific grind just to get my moka pot to work. I refuse to believe it because it doesn't make sense, and people are spinning out trying to make something complex out of something relatively simple.

The steam valve was worn out. It couldn't do it's job anymore. And that's okay. The weird part was that no one really seems to like the idea that the steam valve itself could be broken/worn out from years of dedicated moka potting. Since it seems to be almost impossible to order a replacement valve with any degree of certainty that you'll receive the right part, you should just get a new moka pot. Save the old one, search for a new steam valve (or poach one from other pot) and maybe you'll get your old one up and running. So I just bought a new Moka Express. It works great. While I love to buy nice beans and grind them myself, sometimes I don't give two shits and want to use down n dirty pre-ground Lavazza and get on with my day.

TL;DR: the steam valves on moka pots can wear out; it should be able to handle pre-ground coffee (suited for moka pot); cleaning the piss out of it is only something to do when it's dirty.",1608754944

Recently upgraded from the Bodum Bistro to Fellow Ode. I've been finding the final drawdown of my V60 brews always lags a lot.

I've brewed between 2-4 on the dial but I find it happens at all ranges. Has anyone else experienced this?   

Lately I've been using 16g/266.7g (1:16.67) and pouring 50/50/55/111 @95'C. Cups generally taste nice but there is a bit of over extraction.

Any tips?",1608738087
Coffee,Help a new coffee vendor get setup for the upcoming season! (Equipment recommendations needed),"Hey r/coffee!

   Here's the deal, I'm a vendor at a few farmers markets in my area. Some kinda slow, but I have a few markets that get alot of customers. I currently sell kettle corn and other varieties of popcorn! I love making and selling the corn, but I really need to up my income and these markets. I noticed that each of these markets are lacking coffee vendors. So my plan is to start branching into coffee sales! 

I think as far a licenses and permits go I'm good. I've got my food manager cert and I think I can legally sell in my area. My question more revolves around what actual equipment you guys would recommend to serve a crowd. I assume the best bet is going to be brewing onsite so it can be as fresh as possible. That being said, I want to keep it simple and if possible avoid running a generator if possible. (I think I'm allowed to run one if needed though). 

Again, I want to keep it fairly simple. Maybe 2 varieties of coffee and a decaf blend as well. I'll be offering cream and sugar and the option for iced coffee but I was hoping to keep it self serve since I'll have my hands full running essentially two stands at a time. If I have to I'll hire an extra hand for the coffee but I'd rather not. 

I have a bit of money set aside to purchase equipment by I'm by no means antsy to use much of it. (Probably going to search for used equipment no matter what I buy) 

So, what would you guys recommend? Any help / advice greatly appreciated!!",1608736422

tea,Weird question about drinking tea while sick.,"Hey everyone.

I consider myself a coffee drinker first but have really grown into loving tea over the last few years. I'm not as sophisticated as many of you and tap out at some loose leaf from Harney but overrall I might enjoy a few cups a week.

I noticed that every time I'm sick, coffee becomes unpalatable and my preference for tea skyrockets. It doesn't matter if I'm drinking black tea or a tisane with honey, it just tastes much better. It almost tastes as if coffee becomes a uniform bland bitter taste, but tea almost loses its bitterness and becomes more nuanced than anything else I can taste while sick. I've grown up with my parents pretty much only making tea when we were sick (coffee culture) so I'm wondering if this is just a conditioned response or something else.

Anyway, it's just a weird little thought I had so maybe some of you might have some insight.",1606823828

Alchemy
The culmination of years of processing experience and more than 1,300 processing experiments, the Qima Alchemy Series represents the next generation of coffee processing innovation. We seek to add sensorial value to coffees through applying innovative processing methods to enhance and embolden the coffees' cup profile, whilst maintaining the intrinsic flavors and notes that represent the terroir and the genetic background of the coffee.

The Alchemy series relies on a combination of pressure (up to 10 bar/145 psi), temperature control, gas regulation and managed drying, to develop a truly unique set of coffees with unparalleled flavor expression and structure. All of our processing and fermentation protocols are underpinned by principles of chemical engineering, ensuring our innovations are both sensorially unique and scientifically novel.”

Coffee,[UPDATE] Espresso shot time too fast (still unresolved),"Hi all!

This is an update to my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/kbndan/espresso_shot_time_too_fast/).

I've been very busy IRL so I literally haven't had time to make a coffee till now.

A short summary:

I'm on the Breville SGP and Gaggia Classic Pro (the new one).

Espresso shot time is too fast (\~5-8s), even when I try:

1) Finest grind setting (internal burr setting and grind size dial)

2) Hardest tamping force

3) Ensuring no clumps/channeling (WDT) (I don't own a bottomless portafilter so I can't tell much)

4) Cleaning everything out, especially the grinder

It's weird because I know for a fact that if my grinds were too fine, it'd be impossible to pull a shot as the machine would get choked...so I'm out of ideas here. 

I'll get some pre-ground coffee next time to experiment if it's my grinder.

Coffee,"The noob chronicles-moka pot, day 1","This is kinda a earn with me/critique post.

What happened: I decided to up my coffee game. I got a 6 cup moka pot and timemore c2 yesterday, and this morning brewed my first ever pot. 

The coffee: Unfortunately my locally roasted costa rican coffee didnt arrive yesterday, so all i had was starbucks french roast.

The grind: I initially started at #15. Using timemore's included grind guide(the c2 uses the 5 blade chart, as it has 5 blades). Having no clue where to start or what to expect, i ground at #15 and put some in the hopper. Then i went to the trash can and shook the hopper. The hopper Sieved all the coffee, it all passed through the holes. So i went up 2 grind settings to #17 and waited until the morning.

The brew: To my...disappointment, the c2 is not capable of filling the 6 cup moka pot hopper in 1 grind. Bummer. In retrospect i probably should have done some math. Anyways, i read that i should put boiling water into the moka pot to prevent burning the coffee. Not having a kettle, i just fired up the keurig and filled the boiler. On to my stove. I have an induction electric stove with glass top. Interestingly, the stove pulses a lot of power slowly. After watching the burner glow and cool i found that slightly above medium heat seemed to be doing something. Still, even with hot(not boiling) water in the baee, it took about 5 minutes to brew. Normal? No clue.

The result: Not bad. I do not have a very developed pallet. It is not very bitter, maybe slightly acidic(but not sure), there was absolutely no crema, and i feel like it was very slightly watery(but again, i dont know what a properly brewed moka pot s supposed to taste like. It is stronger than a keurig, but not amazingly strong.)

What im thinking about changing: With the stove settings kinda figured out for now, and hopefully decent coffee arriving today, i think i will try going 1 notch finer on the grinder(at 17, going to 16). I feel like i can get a bit more out of the strength of the pot. 

thanks for reading. Feel free to critique or question.",1608719036
Coffee,Interest in Espresso/Flair products,"Hello Fellow Coffee Addicts,

i recently had an insane cup of espresso from a local roaster and i got interested in the topic. 

I want to go for a manual espresso machine.

I saw some videos on the flair product line.

Right now i only got an encore grinder which isn't meant for traditional espresso, at least that's what i know. So my question is :

Should i got for the Flair Neo with the Pressure Kit and slowly upgrade with for example the bottomless ""Portafilter"" once i get a decent enough grinder? or should i go right ahead and go for the Pro 2?

&amp;#x200B;

I already did calibrated my encore finer if that would make any conceivable difference.

Thanks for taking the time!",1608716835
Coffee,All prupose electric grinder: HELP,"I am looking for an all purpose grinder so I want the most for my buck without going overkill.

So the main question here is something like:

 **""Should I get a lower end Baratza instead of a Niche Zero?""**  

My drinking habits are about 2 to 3 cups every day, primarily from a mokapot and ocasional filter brewing.

It is important to note that I expect to jump into manual espresso soon for ocasional shots (cafelat robot or a flair probably), so my new grinder should at least be able to do decent espresso grind to pull one or two shots a day every now and then. Because of this I am looking at higher end options too that are capable of delivering good espresso grind.

I own a decent handgrinder too but I want the new grinder to serve as the main grinding utility at home.

I will list my options as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Higher end (maybe overkill for my needs?)

* Niche Zero. 
   * PROS: Seems the best all around option from user experience to output quality. Love the looks. Easy to change settings compared to other options.
   * CONS: It is pricy and will have to wait to get ahold of one, maybe an overkill for my needs.
* Eureka Mignon perfetto. 
   * PROS: Ensured long lasting eureka quality and excellent output quality, cheaper than the niche.
   * CONS: Difficult to find one, seems to be a worse option compared to the niche.
* Eureka mignon silenzio. 
   * PROS: Ensured long lasting eureka quality cheaper than niche and perfetto.
   * CONS: Seems too focused to espresso and changing settings from espresso to anything else (which I plan to do often) seems a pain in the ass.
* Baratza Sette 270Wi
   * PROS: Baratza build and consumer service seems to be top notch, output quality seems excellent, really easy to buy one.
   * CONS: I hate how it looks. For that price I think I would be better off with a Niche.

&amp;#x200B;

Lower end (maybe insufficient quality to pull ocasional espresso shots?)

* Baratza Virtuoso+ 
   * PROS: Seems to perform really well even if espresso is hard to tune in, Baratza customer service seems really good
   * CONS: It apears to have static and retention issues like most at its range, dosing with that tray does not seem fun. Looks ugly.
* Sage/Breville Smart Grinder PRO. 
   * PROS: Looks good, a very popular option on the middle range. User experience seems really good.
   * CONS: I dont really care about the ""smart"" features.
* Sage/Breville Dose control PRO. 
   * PROS: Seems to have best value for the money, cheapest of all, I think I prefer this one to the smart one even if it is less popular.
   * CONS: Not sure if it will be able to deliver grind to pull decent espresso shots.

&amp;#x200B;

**My two specific questions would be:**

1. Should I stick with something on my higher end selection or is it an overkill? 
2. Can the lower end selection provide at least DECENT grind for espresso (I do not need excellency for ocasional shots).

I know all the ""should I get a lower end Baratza instead of a Niche Zero"" seems a bit odd, but even if I am willing to spend more than 550€ on a grinder I would rather spend only 150€ if that is good enough for my needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Coffee,My brewing time went up with a gooseneck kettle,"Just a surprise I'd like to share with you after buying a gooseneck kettle. People mentioned here that a gooseneck kettle is not a must and it should be the last thing you buy - and it was so for me, but still I'm happy with that addition as it noticeably impacts how I brew coffee. I used to struggle with to short brewing time in my V60 - most of the coffee was in the cup at about 2:00-2:15. The resulting coffee was too acidic and not extracted enough, but when I ground finer it was still difficult to create a coffee I'd like. The only unquestionably good, sweet coffees were the ones in the 500-600g range when I brewed for two. After the kettle arrived I found it is easier to control the speed of the pouring and to slow it down, plus it's smaller than my electric kettle so balancing is easier too. It's a fine addition, I'm just happy to share this info.",1608706522
Coffee,LIDO E-T grinder grind size change over time or espresso machine worn in and pushing more pressure?,"I got a LIDO E-T last month, when I dialed in (small number finer, larger number coarser), it was at 7 grind setting, and now somehow to maintain the same brew time, I have to set the grinder to 6 grind setting.

initially it was at 7 settings, the brew time would be around 28 sec, and now if the grind setting is left at 7, the brew time is around 12 sec. 

At the beginning if the setting is at 6.5 it would choke my machine, but now I am actually at 6 grind setting to maintain around 28 sec brew time.

I tried with fresher beans, and the result is the same. I also disassembled the grinder and cleaned it, nothing changed.

I wonder if this an issue with the grinder or with my espresso machine, is this some type of worn in effect?

Coffee,Niche Zero - Coarser grinds results in static hell,"I've recently nabbed a wonderful Niche Zero. I'm a new coffee ""enthusiast"". When I grind an espresso shot 18g, it pour neatly into the provided doser with no issue and very little static (just a bit, but knocking on the sides of the doser usually gets all the grinds out). 

Yesterday I tried grinding at a coarser setting for my drip machine (50 on the NZ). My god. Coffee grinds were literally flying out of my container. Now, I know it can be my container at fault. I'll try using something more metallic next time around. But the grinds were sticking to the NZ itself. When I was done I could probably made a coffee pot from the amount of grinds everywhere. 

Any tips or recommendations to reduce static on the coarser settings would be very helpful.

Additional Information:

* Niche Zero - Dial set @ 50 (Coarse)
* Container is a plastic box, will try glass or metal to see if that helps next time around
* Drip Machine is the SCAA-approved Braun Multiserve w/ hot water (I know most don't like it but it was too good a deal to not kopp)
* Did NOT use the water technique due to previous posts mentioning it can cause potential damage to the NZ",1608702939

Coffee,Baratza Forte BG alignment issues,"About 6 months ago, I got and aligned a Forte BG per the instructions on home barista. At the time, it seemed like the burrs were well aligned by the ink test. I used them, probably inadvisably, for both espresso and pour over. Over time, especially these past few weeks, I found myself coarsening my grind significantly for pour over. It seemed like there was an increase in fines. I was at setting 8R on the grinder with touch time at 1H and was still getting a bitter brew. 

Yesterday, I decided enough was enough and took apart the grinder to realign it. The home barista alignment procedure was not working at all at this point. With the levers squared up, the burr was still not getting a flat ink test. I’m not very good with mechanics or machining, so I resorted to the foil method and eventually got a flat ink profile. That said, I have no idea if the axial alignment is fine. On testing, with touch time at 1H, pour over is now at 5Q. 

What exactly happened that caused the grinder to be so out of alignment? I’m assuming it was my switching between espresso and pour over or perhaps a hard object in the burrs. I’m a little paranoid about it now.",1608697292

Both times, I was completely blown away. The flavor profiles are quite unique, and even some of the processes I tried (such as monsoon) were delicious in both medium and light roasts.

Coffee,Thinking outside the box (aeropress recipe),"This IS goining to be „another boring Aeropress recipe (discussion) where people are obsessing the angle of the stirring and water temperature“ so here is my post:
Specialty Coffee Recipes (think outside the box) (questions)

I’m in search of some solid AP recipes. I’m a big fan of the bypass method and in my opinion it’s the best way to brew with the aero press. I have a big problem with dropping this mindset and I really wish to find some new recipes and maybe a little explanation why you brew the way you brew. 

Inverted, I use 20g coffee, medium-fine grind, 100grams  92C water, stir four times and  plunge after one minute until it hisses around 1:20-1:30 
After that I add around 100 +-20 grams of water and decant the liquid like 10 times between to different jugs to lower the temperature and add oxygen for better taste. 

The coffee tastes very fine and decent. Maybe it misses a little bit of body or strength but that’s okay with me. I think it compliments the sweet an sour flavours in these coffees.
Am I wrong in some way?

Do you have any improvement tips, maybe blooming or brew time or a different ratio or temperature? 
What do you think of my recipe? 
Should I free myself from my mindset that bypass it the one and only method of brewing

I've been considering getting an ember mug to keep my coffee warm at my work from home desk. It seems like it gets pretty good reviews in the online coffee people circles, with the downside being that it's quite expensive for what it is. 

My question: does it differ in any significant way in terms of heat delivery/effect from a mug warmer under a ceramic mug? I know burners under glass carafs can overheat coffee and cause some bitterness, but if the ember having a more soft and indect heat through a ceramic wall does not cause that same thing to happen, I don't know how the same wouldn't be true of using a ceramic mug on a mug warmer. 

The temperature setting is obviously cool and helpful, but if I can find a mug warmer that sits around 135/140 F, is there any real benefit an ember will give me over that aside from making me feel quite fancy?

But I never knew it meant cup as in 250ml and not 4-5 fair sized cups (like a bigger water cup but meant for hot liquids). Id say the easiest comparative is the size of a medium tims coffee. 

I easily Have about 3 of those sized cups a day. but if I convert it to 250ml cups its about 5.5-6. If it came to it I could make em a bit weaker so theres less caffeine content. 

Other than that I dont drink pop or energy drinks. Would this rate be a risk to my health? I combine it with nicotine (vaping), so i Know its not the best, but unfortunately I relapsed after being a year clean 2 months ago.

Coffee,Coffee Truck Idea Sans Espresso,"Hello fellow coffee lovers. I have what may be a bit of a controversial topic/question but I want to know my fellow lovers thoughts on this.

I'm a retail entrepreneur and my latest idea revolves around creating a coffee truck of sorts.

However... when I say I'm a coffee lover, I definitely am not a coffee snob by any means. I love a good plain roast with a dash of milk, an iced coffee, etc. It has to be a really fancy day for me to fork over $6+ for a latte, etc. 

Now, as I'm starting to build out this idea I'm coming to find that the aspect of integrating a \*full coffee shop menu\* (i.e. lattes, cappuccinos, etc) just honestly seems way overkill, unnecessarily expensive, and not worth it. However, I'm here to do what the people want, not what I want.

Coffee,Looking for a coffee scale with good accuracy (not just precision),"It looks like I missed a [good thread on scales](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/kcnvh2/updated_scale_recommendations/) just about a week ago so I apologize for covering similar ground.

One thing I've found in reading reviews of coffee scales is that even though they may show high precision in their readings down to 0.1g, they're not actually very accurate. Sometimes you can weigh something, take it off the scale, re-weigh it and get a very different result. One review of the OXO scale said that they tried adding 1 coffee bean at a time, but the weight display didn't change until the 4th bean--and then it suddenly jumped up 0.4g.

Does anyone know of any scales that have been tested for their accuracy? I'd like to make sure that the number in the 10ths place isn't just a random number to make me feel like I've really got it dialed in!

Other features that I am interested in in priority order in case you have some recommendations:

* Can accommodate weights up to 3kg
* Has built-in timer (even better if the timer starts automatically as soon as weight is added)
* Is ok weighing hot things like a metal kettle
* Somewhat water resistant in case I spill something on it
* Rechargeable battery

Anyone know anything that would fit the bill? I think my budget would be up to $100 if I can get all the features on my wishlist.

Coffee,A Warning about the Kinu M47,"tl;dr do not get this grinder unless you plan on upgrading within a year. 

I've had a Kinu M47 for 1.5 years now. I don't use it that often, maybe couple times a week so you would expect it to still be in excellent if not workable condition. Well, it's not. 

When I first got the grinder, the burrs would touch at zero like one would expect. However, as of today, the adjustment ring can be turned 20 full clicks under the zero setting. At the zero setting, the burrs turn freely for about three quarters of a turn but a significant amount of resistance is felt at the remaining quarter, in the same spot every time. This indicates that something has gone TERRIBLY wrong in terms of alignment.

Because of this, the grounds it produces are pretty much unusable, even worse than what you would get from a Hario Skerton. Usually, brewing a V60 with 20g of ground coffee at a 4.0.0 setting takes about 2:30 to finish draining completely. However, as of now, even after 10 minutes the water does not finish draining completely and the slurry is full of sludge. Even grinding at an extremely coarse setting (like one would use for a french press) still clogs the filter paper.

I've spoken to several others who have also purchased an M47 and all of them reported experiencing the exact same issue after a similar duration, with one person having this problem after slightly under a year of use. This problem has been reported with every version of the M47 except the simplicity as I do not know anyone who has owned one, but I expect it also has the same flaw. 

I have been trying to get a hold of the company for advice and possibly a replacement for about a month now, both via email and Facebook messenger. They have yet to respond. The same goes for the other community members who have contacted them about the same issue.

While I do not have a sufficient sample size to confidently say that this will happen with every M47 or even most M47s, it definitely seems to be a common issue which the company has never addressed and for which there is no solution. I have not heard of similar issues with other high-end manual grinders such as the Lido 3 or Comandante C40.

IMO a hand grinder that costs a couple hundred bucks lasting only 1 to 2 years is a terrible deal. Although the M47 is easy to use and can produce great coffee initially, I would highly discourage anyone looking for a high-end manual grinder from getting one  due to this issue and the company's lack of communication and support.

I won't be brewing coffee for quite some time since I cannot afford another grinder (I lost my job due to covid) but when I can, I sure as hell won't be getting a Kinu.",1608662491
Coffee,Good small coffee maker?,"Hey!

I'm trying to get into the coffee world but my family are avid tea drinkers. They do not want a giant coffee machine in our house, are there any machines that are not that big (or thermos sized all in ones) that have good flavor and are fairly easy to use?

I've been looking at the cafflano (klassic but also the go-brew) but they advertise it with water and I cant make coffee with water, I'd use milk but I'm afraid that the machine may not work as well or might break if I used milk....

Any advice would be great ;)",1608662446
Coffee,"Bought an aeropress and a hario grinder last saturday, they are absolutely amazing!","First time posting here and english is not my first language so excuse any mistake. 

Last saturday I was on a christmas fair here in santiago de chile, with nothing interesting to buy, and then I saw a small coffee shop selling coffee and some small machine, and then I started to talk with the guy and saw that he was selling good equipment, I saw ""aeropress"" and instantly thought of this subreddit and all the comments on how good it was, and decided to try it and bought it along with a hario mini slim plus and some coffee bags. 

I was a noob regarding coffee but I have different ways to have a normal coffee at home (powdered coffee, a classical american coffee machine, a dolce gusto) and nothing, NOTHING compares to a good quality coffee that has been just grinded.  
I've been using it at least once a day, and i'm already teaching my dad on how to use it. 

 thank you for reminding me to always improve on how to take my coffee.

I played around with a few settings like 7G and 7C and it still tastes like it should be finer. What do you all use for medium fine with South American coffee?

Coffee,Drip and French Press grinder for coffee shop?,"Looking for a grinder for specialty coffee that can handle doing drip/pourover/aeropress/french press in a coffee shop (higher volumes than home grinder, needs to be reliable, consistent, and well built). What I've had recommended to me so far is something like the Mahlkonig gh2, but that seems more geared towards batch grinding, whereas we'd only be looking to grind between 20-150 grams at a time. Is the Mahlkonig still a good option for that, or is there something else I should be looking into? I know the ek43 is supposed to be top of the line for this kind of thing, but I'm worried it would be overkill, and if there's something cheaper out there that will do specialty coffee justice, that would be preferable.

I've used Bunn g2/g3 grinders in the past, really looking for something that does a better job in the flavor and noise categories. Does anyone have any experience with a grinder that they think would be good for this? Anyone have any thoughts on how the Mahlkonig grinders would do here?",1608659331

Coffee,When can I stop blaming my technique and start blaming the beans?,"TL;DR: when do I decide my technique is good enough and start buying nicer beans?

So I’ve been an espresso drinker for a while, but never made my own coffee other than cold brew. I had some incredible pour overs, like the kind where you can smell the fruit from an arms length away and immediately bought a V60, a Timemore C2 and a mail order subscription as I don’t live near any roasters I really enjoy.

I’ve been trying to choose the brightest, fruitiest, lightest roasts on the website I subscribe to. Some of these beans have smelled pretty astounding just through the bag. About halfway through my second bag, I felt I had a good idea of what tasted dialed in, but I’m still not getting super fragrant cups. I am absolutely getting the tasting notes on the bag and I’m getting the fruit aromas that are detectable on the unground beans, but I want a super sweet and fragrant cup, and I am no where close to some of the professional pour overs I’ve had.

I am keen to try some nicer beans, especially some limited release roasts or geishas some roasters I like offer, but if my technique is the issue I don’t want to waste my money on beans that are still gonna taste like grocery store coffee with mild hints of more interesting flavors.

How do I know if I am getting the most my beans have to offer?

Coffee,"Cold Brew: to dilute, or not to dilute?"," First post in this sub, hi everyone! So, the crux of my question: the manufacturer of my cold brew coffee maker calls the liquid it produces a ""concentrate"" and the instructions say to dilute it 50/50 with hot water when you want to make a cup of coffee with it. But when I've tried this, the result is just *too* watery and kinda tasteless. Heating up the undiluted ""concentrate"" with a splash of sweetened creamer does result in a very strongly flavored drink, but I really like it that way. Is there any reason not to just drink the cold brew undiluted like this?   


 In anticipation of questions I might get: yes I follow all the manufacturer's instructions exactly when preparing my cold brew, so there's no reason to think the resulting ""concentrate"" is weaker than intended. Yes, I am aware the undiluted coffee is probably extra caffeinated - I have ADHD and caffeine really helps me focus and think clearly, so that's not a bad thing for me.",1608639814

I won't buy my own anymore, I'll just go halves in whatever you get from now on""

tea,Why is sugar in tea a controversial thing among some?,I often see among the more hobby oriented types that sugar is just the worst to put in your tea.

It is possible my palate isn’t as good at picking up the nuances as easily as others though. I was curious to see what the community opinion is on this.,1606690242

I'd compare them to Assam but with heavier citrus notes. 

Great on their own, or with a drop of milk or sugar, sometimes both. I typically do western style brewing. But I've also enjoyed it grandpa style.

tea,How do you store 10-50g samples?,"I made my first tea order ever 17 days ago from What-Cha (still waiting btw and the tracking says it's still in UK). Then I made 3 orders from MeiLeaf. 2 hours ago I did another big order full of samples from Taiwan Tea Crafts. I did the math. I ordered 33 different teas between 3g (1 white tea only) and 250g (went all in with Dong Ding and I've never even had one but I fell in love with Taiwanese Oolongs that I tried for first time this week).

I have 9 tins that can store 500g tea (3 of them can store up to 1kg). But 30 of these 33 teas are 25 or 50g (4-5x10g). The ones from Taiwan Tea Craft are not ziplocs I think and some of the MeiLeaf samplers are also not ziplocs. I suppose I cannot put them unsealed in the same tin as thry will absorb aromas and a cross-contamination will happen for sure (I've heard that tea is like a sponge for smells).

What should I do? My shopping addiction caught me unprepared. I tried my first Taiwanese Oolong and I was so blown away that I couldn't stop myself of ordering and ordering. I feel bad now. 

How do you store samples and smaller pouches of tea? Do you leave it in the pouch? 1035g tea with my 50ml gaiwan is not that easy to consume fast. And my ADHD will make me open all of them to try 2 different teas every single day until I try all of them. I guess I should just buy 30 tins lol. But I can't find smaller ones.

I have realized tea is my passion. My true passion, I want to travel to China and learn from the source. I really want to open a teahouse and teach people everything about it.

Now my current uni course isn’t related to it(I like the course though, but more as a hobby) and I dont know if I should finish uni, change course to something more related to tea or drop out. And how should I go about it all?
The problem is I am kinda scared.

tea,Does anyone know of a superior filtration method for your tea?,"Hello all,  


I have become a perfectionist with my tea, obsessive is a small word for it. and lately one of my fixations has been the particulate in tea.   


I despise the particulate in tea with a passion, especially with teas where the particulate slowly leeches more bitter flavors into the tea. I used to avoid this by only getting  carefully tended whole leaf teas I can use and trust to have no particulate, but I want to be more flexible now.  


here is my dilemma: I haven't found a metal tea strainer that is fine enough. the only filtration method I have found that is fine enough for me are tea bags, in which the paper or cloth can filter all the particulate out. but the bigger dilemma is that tea bags restrict the flavor.  


I have done tests on my teas, and found that in a tea bag, vs loose leaf with water poured over, vs loose leaf with water and stirred up, the differences in flavor are magnitudes different. I prefer the full flavor from gently stirred tea that mingles with the water entirely, but then filtering the particulate is a pain.  


Should I just get a pourover device for coffee to strain my tea through a coffee filter? I would prefer to avoid needing a disposable thing like paper, and would hopefully like to avoid any potential flavor contamination in the tea.   


is there a place you can get something on the scale of 100-150 mesh strainers that are only 3 inches or so? that would be ideal, but every vendor I find for a tea strainer can't verify mesh size.",1606591651

Coffee,How do I jazz up my Delonghi Dedica?,"I like the espresso that comes out of it. It tastes amazing no complaints there, but I've been failing at making latte art with it. Not sure where I'm messing it up but wanted to know if there are any upgrades I can get to make it easier for me to make latte art. I have a feeling it's one of these things that need improvement:

1. Espresso has too much bubbles
2. Frothed milk has bigger bubbles even after tapping
3. Canvas while pouring milk not clear to begin with

Here are the upgrades that I'm considering. Let me know if those are worth it or if there are other upgrades:
1. Removing metal frother and using just the silicone tube: This definitely helps and I've seen an improvement in my latte art but the tube sometimes gets spit out and drops into the jug and I've to fish it out
2. Portafilter upgrade: This is a ~$50 upgrade and I was wondering if I could only replace the filter. Can I just get a premium filter basket that fits into my current portafilter?

Coffee,My 2020 obsession: Natural-Process lighter roast espresso,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi,

I've been drinking and loving espresso for as far as I remember, and really got into it through dark italian classic ristrettos, but recently I found excitement on totally different espressos

In 2020 I got into home roasting, for both myself and my GF who drinks mostly light drip coffee with a preference for Ethiopian. So I started to roast some Ethiopian natural-process (dry-process) into a medium roast for myself as well, and trying to brew them as espresso. Took me a while to figure out the sweet spot in terms of roasting, grinding and brewing, but for about 6 months now I've been enjoying pretty amazing lighter-roast espressos.

There is a lot of adjustments depending on the feel and beans, but basically I am gravitating around this baseline:

* Natural Process (dry, not washed) green beans from Africa, generally Ethiopian from Guji (found some fantastic Shakiso lately) Sidamo or Yirgacheffe, or Uganda
* Roasted to a light medium (40 to 50 secs into first crack, sometimes a bit more) in order to get a light/medium roast with still some decent caramelisation of the sugars
* Brewed on a 2:1 ratio (about 18g coffee for a 35ml pull), with about 8-10 sec pre-infusion, 35-40 sec pulling time at 95c temperature, at pretty high pressure (10-11 bars) in order to maximise extraction

It generally results in something very lively yet bold. Definitely looking great with dense dark-caramel color crema, pretty thick concentrated creamy texture. Begins with strong molasses flavors (characteristic of the african natural processes I believe), generally evolves with bright acidity with citrus/floral notes, and finishes in a more classical chocolate/almondy long notes. Insanely long aftertaste, you can feel it lasting after more than 30 minutes sometimes...

I've been really addicted to these types of espresso, love the balance between sweetness/acidity/bitterness and the very rich/complex flavours and dense texture.

Anyone else into those? I often find the Ethiopian espressos being brewed on a 2:1.25 - 2:1.3 ratio, trying to mimic somehow a drip 3rd wave cup, and I believe that's always a bit of a mistake, as they have so much to offer if you keep them concentrated... But happy to hear your thoughts about that!",1608576639

I was extremely tired and I was hoping it would make me more awake. I don't think it made me sleepy or anything I just don't think it works. I've had those massive bottles of pepsi/coke (normally diet because I prefer the taste) and been able to go to sleep soon after. 
What I also find weird is that people in my family (especially my dad) would have a couple glasses of coke or have a coffee before bed and he will complain how it couldn't sleep at all. Coffee does make me feel jittery but it just doesn't effect me in the way I feel it should.

I drink a lot of soft drinks and I drink a bit off coffee for the taste (my dad always makes it so he makes me one).",1608568450

Coffee,Noticed my espresso shots are pulling unevenly; can you help me troubleshoot?,"Hi all. This sub inspired me to spring for a full espresso setup earlier this year, which I have enjoyed greatly thus far! However, I've noticed that no matter how hard I try, my espresso shots always seem to pull faster on one side of the portafilter than the other. When I look at the bottom of my (bottomless) portafilter, I see that one side has a visibly higher flow rate and as a result, one side is ""darker"" while the other side is lighter/flowing faster, which I presume will result in uneven and over-/under-extraction. 

So far I've tried and ruled out the following:

- portafilter basket: tried rotating it 180 degrees, same issue
- tamping: tried rotating the basket before and after tamping; same issue (but it did switch sides in both cases)

My second troubleshooting step means (I think) I've narrowed it down to the grinder (or grinding step, at least; not sure if it's the machine or me), but either way, I have found that the only way to reliably ""switch"" which side pulls faster/slower is to rotate the filter basket at some point after grinding. What I'm not certain of is whether the issue is that I'm not moving the basket around enough during grinding and getting uneven distribution, or if the characteristics of the grounds size distribution from the grinder itself are at fault here.

Any advice on what the issue may be, or how to diagnose it/resolve it, would be greatly appreciated!",1608558739

Coffee,Hand Grinder Static,"I am struggling to get all of the grounds out of my Comandante hand grinder with the grounds clinging to both the jar and the bottom of the burrs.

I believe the Encore has anti-static plastic so grounds would hardly get stuck in the bin. It was so bad with the Comandante that I could lose or gain up to half a gram of grounds from what is retained in the grinder.

I just discovered that if I vigorously shake the hand grinder after grinding, I can prevent most of the grounds from sticking to the glass but I still have grinds sticking to the burr exit. Shaking the grinder is a big improvement, but does anyone have any tips or techniques for reducing the amount of grounds retained in their grinder?",1608557761

Was thinking of purchasing a Hario Switch. Currently using an Aeropress with good results but I feel I need to progress and find a better brewer. Or I maybe just need a new brewer to experiment with. 

The switch doesn’t seem to receive the fame and glory of the likes of the V60. Maybe it’s because it’s fairly new. 

The barriers to making this purchase are that I tried using a V60 and found it quite variable in its results. I also tried the Clever Dripper but just had a preference for the Aeropress at the time. The switch seems to be a combination of the V60 and the Clever. I assume it can fully emulate the brewing process of the V60 and the Clever?

I am willing to give pour over/immersion brewing another go. Can anybody recommend the Switch?  I assume a gooseneck kettle is a compulsory purchase along with the Switch?",1608554300

I am looking into replacing my ninja coffee bar with the breville. I have a question about the single cup option though.

I work nights 3 days a week, so half the time my wife and I brew single cup the other days I'm off we brew a pot. This us why we had the ninja, even though it's not great, it did that well.

On the breville, if you brew single cup does it pull out just the amount of water for the size of cup selected or do you have to pre measure the water?",1608527472
Coffee,Need some guidance (New to coffee),I have been a long time lurker but really need to kick the energy drinks. I used to love this local spot that made coffee. I would also get an Orange Latte or Raspberry. I've been told to get a french press and start there. I don't mind adding a little sugar free syrup (I know most will snub their nose at this). I typically like a sweeter coffee and not too bold but dig the caffeine. Could anyone guide me into what I may need to get started? I've looked at a ton of french presses and they all seem reasonable. I don't need more than 12oz. I don't even know which beans I should go with. Any recommendations or guidance is much appreciated. &lt;3,1608525531

Should I be doing something different to get the most flavor? The coffee is the Trader Joe’s French Vanilla and my vessel is a Primula Burke pitcher. How do I get the most flavor in general out of my cold brew coffee?

Coffee,"Near-to-newbie here, looking at getting a Flair Neo espresso maker to get into making espresso. Is it worth it","Currently I use a Chemex as my daily driver to make coffee, and I work for a local cafe as a barista. However I've been more or less regurgitating what I was taught over the last few years of employment, and I was looking to start experimenting with espresso beyond mindlessly turning out drink after drink. Since I got my Christmas bonus, I was wondering if it was worth it to splurge and get a Flair Neo. Currently I use either a Hario Skerton Pro or a Bodum electric grinder (don't even remember the model name), so I don't have a decent espresso grinder for the doses I'd be using. However my hope is for one of two things. Either using a pressurized portafilter like on the Neo is enough for me to find out if making espresso is for me, or if I don't like making it, I could resell the Neo on the used market.

For Neo owners out there, and just the community in general, is this a good idea? Is there cheaper ways? I considered a moka pot, however I don't want to have to fool around with one, since our stove isn't quite suited to it.",1608524109

- able to steep at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95 and 100 degrees Celsius
-No plastic anywhere where it will be contact with the water
-under 100 pounds (ideally)

tea,"Bai Mu Dan (Fuding, China)","My first gaiwan session with white tea. 

I've heard that Bai Mu Dan (White Peony) is a lower grade of white tea but it reminds me a lot of green tea which I am not a fan of, but in the combination of the strong floral fragrance, the fresh ""greenness"" was super refreshing and delicious. 

And I've also heard that it is recommended not to use a strainer so the fluffy parts will potentially improve the texture. Well I didn't strain it, but didn't notice to be more thick or something like this. So IDK. I mean... the leaves are big enough to be filtered easily by the gaiwan lid so a strainer was not needed anyway.

This white tea caught me unprepared - I could not distinguish almost any notes (for some reason the oolongs and the yesterday's pu'erh were easier). There are a lot of acacia trees in my country and city (we have a lot of acacia raw honey as well), so I definitely felt the acacia flowers aroma and I felt a lot of greenness, almost like a green tea with strong sweet aftertaste. But nothing else  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  It was a bit too fragrant and overwhelming to my baby nose (drinking a specialty tea for the first time this week).

Oh and one last thing - did I use too much white tea? 3g for 50ml gaiwan? I felt it a little too strong. I thought that the white tea is generally more gentle, but I felt some really tiny bitter bite at the back of my throat. I mean it was so subtle that I even enjoyed it (but not dry at all). The description on the sample pouch says 1.75g per 50ml. So I think that it was indeed a little too much. But I googled ""white tea, gaiwan, gong fu"" and it says 3-3.5g per 50ml.

I was hoping some of you guys where active in r/matcha too, so I was trying to bring light to this situation. I will repost it in r/matcha but I'm seriously afraid I might get banned.



&gt;&gt;&gt;Very recently I've been trying to contact u/proxwell about a topic that's very dear to my heart. I'm just going to copy paste what I wrote as it basically includes all the information I want to get across.

""Hey there, as I'm sure you may have already noticed, I'm a big advocator of a tagged or otherwise easily accessible wiki/faq section. I've talked to a few of the most active members on r/matcha and received very positive feedback for this suggestion. I was planning on creating an account that will function as a moderator that different people can access [like an account sharing one password, so there's no need to appoint more people as moderators]. This way we can create our own taskforce to provide reliable and easily accessible information for newcomers leaving more space for informational content. I was thinking about the likes of you, metamorph1980, parawhore, haribor and myself but I am open to anybody willing to contribute in this project ( as long as reliable informations are provided ). I know that there are many controversial topics such as storage and organic tea and by listing all the different aspects there are we could avoid the confusion that many different, contrasting answers and opinions would make new people suffer. Now I know that you've created this community and we obviously need your approval to start this project. What do you think of that? Are you interested in helping us out and possibly even taking part in our 'taskforce'. Is one account too risky? I'm sure someone is willing to accept the role as mediator and moderate the consensus of our taskforce - I would love to do so as well but I have 0 moderating experience so it might be a steep learning curve. Anyways I feel like active helpful and knowledgeable people should definitely play a role in this community and would likely benefit the growth of this subreddit by functioning as a moderator especially due to at least 2 of the 4 mods being seemingly inactive. kind regards, Thomas""

Now I'm not sure what to make of u/proxwell ignoring my messages and ignoring suggestions to improve this community for the longest time. He may just be busy and have not seen my messages, that's absolutely ok, but I don't see that as a good sign either when 2/4 mods are inactive by definition and the creator doesn't respond to messages either as it seems. Or he just doesn't really care to improve the community - after all he didn't want to add a review tag either - and I'm sure that's one of the more interesting categories next to all pretty pictures that would much rather fit Instagram. I'm not trying to make reproaches against anybody of the mod team but it's not hard to notice how little care is given to this community and I can't quite understand why they don't seek additional help for their team.

I'd be very happy if u/proxwell or anybody from the mod team would answer to my proposal and interact with the community. I don't care who you decide to add to your mod team, but there are many people that are very helpful to this community and a lot more active than current mods. Currently I'm working at an alternative plan to outsource an FAQ/Wiki in case there will actually be no official response to this post. I'm a firm believer that there's no rightful owner to a topic such as matcha thus I feel like active and involved people should be given the medium to improve this community.

So far I haven't even contacted u/metamorph1980, u/haribor or u/parawhore but I'm pretty sure they all would be very happy to offer their knowledge and contribute to this project as we have been talking about a Wiki for quite some time now but have only poked deaf ears so far..

So what do you - dear reader that has made it all the way down here - think of my suggestion? I would have loved to make a poll, but so far this is not possible.. - it might be in some time though... Hopefully..&lt;&lt;&lt;",1606464238

tea,Gongfu brewing with a quick breakfast (Jing Mai sheng pu'er),"This is mostly about sharing a tea brewing preference, about how Gongfu brewing can work as an effective method with a 20 minute breakfast.  This breakfast isn't what I normally eat, something that requires cooking, but my wife was up early and she made that.  I eat pastry or cereal, often with fruit.  The tea is a Jing Mai version from Tea Mania, a Swiss vendor.  It's a really amazing tea version for the limited price I paid for the cake, well above average in quality level, probably the single best value source for sheng that I'm aware of.

Western brewing is a good option if time is tight but to me the results are never quite as good for some tea types.  Sheng pu'er in particular seems to turn out better brewed Gongfu style, and I wouldn't Western brew good Wuyi Yancha or Dan Cong oolong, or even a high quality rolled oolong of some sort.  For a cheap version of Anxi TGY or Thai oolong it wouldn't make as much difference; losing out a bit related best-case results wouldn't matter.  Basic black and green teas or blends work out just as well brewed Western style, and out of habit I would brew shu pu'er or white teas Gongfu style but it really doesn't make much difference.

I use a thermos because I also use a water heater that's part of a filtration system (using local Bangkok tap water), more the kind of thing that would turn up in an office, but it's at home.  I've done experiments comparing the filtered tap water with bottled versions and results are just different more than better or worse.  It helps that the water quality is much better than it was a decade ago.

The trick is to keep it all moving.  Combining infusions works (stacking), and using a second cup to help draw the heat out when it's too hot to drink right away.  I don't strain tea, although that is typical, and transferring from cup to cup can also help with sorting out some stray bits, just not pouring out the last of it, then pouring it out elsewhere.  If time is really tight, as it often is for me, since I'm always running late, using a third glass of water can draw out even more heat, drinking water between rounds from one of the cups, because a hot cup won't cool hot tea.  Obviously the lid is usually on the gaiwan, for the 10 seconds or so that brewing takes; showing the leaves is just part of this photo arrangement.

I'm in the habit of brewing tea in a gaiwan relatively full of leaves.  I don't measure the amounts but I'd imagine that's 6 or 7 grams in a 90-100 ml gaiwan.  Dropping back the tea amount and lengthening the infusion times slightly wouldn't change results much, so that part is just habit.  Since it will brew at least 10 infusions, and closer to 15, that adds up to drinking a lot of tea, and quite a bit of caffeine intake.  I tend to often drink around a liter of tea in the morning, roughly the equivalent of 4 eight-ounce cups.  There's no set time that breakfast takes, with all that mixed in with dealing with kids, and whatever other details.

There's more on how brewing practice like that goes, and a review of that particular tea, in the ""Tea in the Ancient World"" blog that I write.

tea,My first Pu'erh (ripe) ever,"Gong Ting Zi Juan from Spring, 2014 (Bulang, Yunnan, China)

&amp;#x200B;

[1st steep \(after 2 rinses\)](https://preview.redd.it/hxjw31mtik161.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b96b06f7703a36906ac68163882c42a9bf8902)

I've tried pu'erh in a cafe before, but it was terrible and I gave it to the others. This is the first one that I've made myself. I'm new to gaiwans (my 4th session actually), so I did what I've seen in Youtube or Reddit posts - did 2 flash rinses (tried the 2nd one, lol) and then... I'm currently drinking my 11th steep. 

First 2 steeps (after the rinsing) were kinda weird and light - good flavors, but 0 taste. But once the tea leaves got unstuck (no clue what's the real word) from the cake pieces (it is a 15g sample - 3 whole pieces with very little loose leaves), the taste joined the party. Immediately the liquid became less watery and it was very surprising. I'm a wine drinker, so this felt 95% like Syrah wine to me. If I didn't know what I'm drinking, I would've said that this is diluted Syrah. And Syrah is my favourite wine, so... pretty enjoyable. 

I was so scared to taste pu'erh, because of astringency and bitterness, but it had none of these things (not even a little dryness). Also people here told me that ripe pu'erhs could be fishy - no fishy smells at all (or my nose is not working properly, lol). 

So between the 3rd and 6th steeps I had a blast drinking it but suddenly it lost all of its taste again and color after the 5-6th steep - the color is lighter than the Amber GABA Oolong that I had yesterday. I'm so disappointed again. I'm currently steeping it for 11th time (4 minutes, 100C) for 5 minutes. Ok it's ready, I will upload an image.

&amp;#x200B;

[11th steep \(3g tea, 100C water, 5 minutes brewing time\)](https://preview.redd.it/n3hvaxf6nk161.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a325861c09846289e242fbee110ed35c6f8181c)

Is it normal to lose color, taste and 50% ot fragrance at the 6th steep? Should I steep it for longer? This is 3g tea, 100C water, 5 minutes. I thought that the pu'erh will remain stronger for a long time. The Oolongs I had last days were pretty enjoyable at least for 10 steeps (the Gui Fei was really tasty for 12-14 steeps) and I had high expectations from a ripe pu'erh. I should probably try raw pu'erh now.

Is it normal? Any tips? Should I try to steep it for like 30 minutes? :D 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I think that I enjoyed it a lot, because it was sweet, not bitter, not astringent (not at all) and the fragrance reminded me of my favourite wine (Syrah). I was disappointed by the watery taste after the 5-6th steep, but that's ok. I still had fun. I didn't expect to be blown away by $0.3-0.4/g ripe pu'erh but I'm so curious about pu'erh now. I thought that I would not like it at all, but it was definitely very enjoyable. 

I want to try raw pu'erh now. I will have free shipping from Mei Leaf soon and What-Cha is also free, so I will order probably next month. If you think that these vendors are not the best vendors for pu'erh, I will consider buying from another vendor if the shipping cost is not too high.

So I'm open to raw pu'erh suggestions. Not bitter or astringent if possible. I quite liked the fruitness of this one. It was like boiled dried berries with spices and a little sweet, and not dry at all. But I know that raw pu'erh is completely different thing. I think I entered a rabbit hole today and I will be broke soon, lol.",1606391856

Okay, so my goal is to be able to make a strong iced latte at home. Now, my palate for coffee isn't the most refined (if we were talking IPAs we'd have a different story) and I usually go in the mornings and get a caramel iced latte from Dunkin. If I really have the time I'll stop and get the same thing, but from my local, independent coffee shop. After lurking here I heard people mention Moka pots being able to make faux-espresso drinks, or at least something close. I've tried a few different things, but with low-tier coffee which is not getting me very far. Here's my Moka process:

-Pre-boil water and add to the bottom of pot

-Fill basket with medium-fine ground coffee and level off

-Place on edge of flame and heat until the coffee becomes a gurgling bubble. I usually go low heat so the coffee just barely trickles out of the spout

-Run Moka pot under cold water.

I think I have the method down, but I need to get some freshly roasted coffee, and I've been looking at Third Coast Roasters, found in the comments here. What roast would be best? I don't see an espresso-specific offering, so I was thinking Columbian?

Normally we brew with our Chemex at home but have recently switched to Kalita Wave because we can't source any Chemex filters. I end up brewing 2 or 3 Wave batches (about 350 grams of water each) as a substitute for the Chemex we used to use.

We have some of those cloth/reusable filters and they do not replicate the paper filters well, they either drain too fast or don't drain at all. They are also constantly falling into the pour/breathing tube which further modifies the draining time. I like looking up Chemex recipes and following them and with these cloth ones I can't follow them because the drain times are completely different. Sometimes the coffee comes out tasting great, other times its too weak, sour, etc.

Coffee,Roasters' choices for packaging beans,"I've been trying some different roasters based on suggestions of fellow commenters.  I realize that cost is an important factor, but wondered whether some types of packages seem more expensive while less effective at preserving beans.  That's my perception, and I'm prepared to be corrected.  Some roasters use ""standard,"" lined paper bags, with or without air vents or zip-lock closures.  Some of the paper bags arrive in rather attractive cardboard boxes, which appear the most costly packaging choice.  Other roasters pack beans in plastic, vented barrier bags.  

My guess is that the plastic barrier bags afford the best choice for preserving freshness and allowing beans to degas.  The paper bags seem impervious to air, but absent a vent, don't allow the brewer to ""re-vacuum"" the package between brews.  I wouldn't avoid a roaster simply because of the packaging, but do folks repackage newly received beans to improve shelf life?",1608490586

I thought that pouring water at 100 deg C would be OK, as temperature was very quickly lost and  stabilised at around 96 deg C within a few seconds.  However, I always end up with characteristics of both under-extraction (sourness) and over-extraction (bitterness, hollow feel, drying effect).  I have tried altering the brew time in 10 second increments, but have been unable to get good results.  A shorter time would yield a dry, bitter coffee, but very thin, light brown and sour.  Brewing for a longer time would just increase the dryness and bitterness while remaining sour.  There is no liveliness and the coffee tastes dead.  Most significantly, after effects of drinking the coffee would be stomach ache (like acid is sitting in my stomach), dehydration and generally feeling ill.

If I ensure the water is below 98 deg C on initial contact, I find time works as expected: too short and the coffee is sour, too long and the coffee is bitter.  With the right time it is possible to achieve wonderful liveliness on the tongue, full flavour, and any bitterness enhances the flavour.  Most importantly, I feel healthy and energetic afterwards, and not like I've just drunk the contents of a battery.

Has anybody experienced the same, and is there any scientific explanation to support my experience?  I can only theorise that:

a) when boiling water touches the coffee, even for an instance, it causes some undesirable reaction; or

b) by letting the water reach a full boil, oxygen/CO2/something else is lost from the water which negatively affects the extraction process.  I notice that to get to 100 deg C, it is necessary to boil for an extended period and the water bubbles a lot.  Whereas when heating to just 98 deg C, there is almost no bubbling.",1608485862
Coffee,Coffee vs. COVID,"Hope everyone is bundled up with a good cup of coffee! I wanted to share my experience with COVID, and talk about how it has completely destroyed my ability to taste or smell coffee specifically. I got sick on November 23rd, and ultimately lost my sense of smell and taste about 1 week in. While it has been returning for most other things, I cannot taste or smell coffee AT ALL (interestingly, the first thing I could taste again was banana). Of course, this is preferable to having been hospitalized, or put on a ventilator, but it's been pretty sad. I had ordered a nice Ethiopian from Madcap in Michigan to enjoy in December, but haven't been able to enjoy it at all. 

I'm curious if anyone else has the misfortune to get sick, and if so: did you experience a similar issue with coffee specifically? Did your sense of taste recover? I know I am BEYOND lucky to have experienced a mild illness, but not being to taste my favorite taste is disheartening. 

Happy holidays to all of you, and please stay safe!",1608485669

How do I begin to develop an understanding of what tasting notes I like and those I don’t so that I can be a little more adventurous? It all seems so subjective.

I would buy a pre-ground tin of McDonalds coffee from Costco and would not portion control properly. Did someone say eight heaping table spoons for 8 cups of coffee for one person? Yep, that was me. V60? Snobby a little. Coffee connoisseurs were off-putting but so was the taste of my coffee... Fast-foward: I put a moka pot on my Christmas list. Super cool, super excited. Then I put a Capresso Infinity on the list. After reading carefully, I realized I know very little!  I switched the Capresso for the Baratza Encore. I, then, got a gift from my Reddit Secret Santa and low and behold, it was a Craft Coffee manual! So I have a moka pot and grinder and a Craft Coffee manual to confirm my Encore purchase. Turns out I was missing a scale. So I purchased a scale! So I have a moka pot, a decent drip machine, but I'm missing a coffee maker. Well, thanks to all the advice on this sub, I bought a Clever.

Should I cup it, then try to bring out the specific flavors while brewing? Should I wait longer or shorter before starting to brew?

Coffee,Any recommendations for drip coffee maker?,"I'm not much of a coffee snob but I love coffee! My coffee maker broke and I'm looking to buy a new one. It was a very cheap drip coffee maker. I used whole beans, ground them in the morning and dumped the coffee grounds in the basket (with a paper filter), poured some water and hit the button. Honestly I can't do more than this every morning, so I think I'm going with another drip machine that all I have to do is grinding coffee and pouring water and hit the button.  

I don't mind an upgrade though, if there's much upgrade that can be done for this setting. I think a limiting factor for me is the size of the machine. We make 3 cups of coffee every morning, so a 5-cup size would be best for us while most coffee makers on the market are 10-cup+. Regarding the price, preferably something under $150 would be good.

I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I personally love sipping on an ultra bitter 1 liter cup of boiled green tea.

I put a good handful of tea in a pot, fill it in a pot with ~1.2l of water and boil it on the stove for a good 10-20 minutes. I then put it in a very large pot without sugar or other additives and when I finish drinking it, I sometimes chew a bit on the leaves like chewing gum(I don't swallow it though, it's kinda rough)
I know that green tea has a lot of health benefits, like amino acids, catechins and other compounds and a lot of ""concentration agents"" like caffeine. I just want to make sure if I destroy these in the process and if that is the case, how I could make the most bitter green tea while keeping the benefits.

tea,Solid glass teapot recommendations,"To my dear fellow tea enthousiastes, 

I come to you on this day to seek your advice as we begin our descent into the depths of winter.

To cut to the chase: I’m looking for a teapot.

Recently I had the misfortune of dropping (while hand washing) my glass teapot, that I had purchased from Muji.  A teapot with which I was very satisfied.

“Why not purchase another similar teapot?” The astute reader may ask.

The answer is simple: I did purchase another one. I broke that one too.

It may be a question of me being more careful, and to submit to the reality that glass breaks.  However, - and this might be due to my inherent stubbornness - I believe that another solution is out there!

My requirements are here-forth.  I’m looking for a teapot that is:

- Solid.  I understand that this is a difficulty many tea-lovers have, and that breakage is a part of life... short of using a cast-iron teapot, which leads me squarely to my next point:
- Light.  When I drink tea, this is a moment of calm.  No loud noises, no heavy lifting, no clanging metal.  Heat transference isn’t a major issue on my radar.
- Easy to clean.  This was a major reason why I liked the teapot from Muji - you could get your hand right in there to clean it, dry it, polish it.  Not a fan of teapots that have nooks and crannies that are difficult, or spots where you can’t really see if it’s clean.  Glass is obviously quite good for this, therefore the next dot point is...
- Glass (preferably).  I like the way glass looks.  It’s simple and almost austere, but in an elegant way.  The issue is that glass breaks, and especially if the teapot is a complex design, you’re asking for trouble! 
- Easy to store.  I live in Paris.  Space is scarce.  Long spouts, big round teapots, big handles - all a big no-no.  We are looking for teapots that maximise vertical real-estate and minimise horizontal space.
- Aesthetically pleasing.  This seems like an unnecessary point, but I’d argue to the contrary; we are making tea here, it’s about the whole experience, including the visuals!  I’m generally against plastics, but if you have a lead then convince me - and yes, that’s a challenge!

While I think this covers all of my unreasonable requirements, I’m sure I’ve missed something, in which case I will edit or comment below. 

Many thanks for any suggestions or ideas you may have.",1606339190

tea,Starter Loose Tea,"Hello,

I'm looking for a good sampler of loose teas that would cover a decent range of types of teas. Some context:

My mom really likes tea and has a large collection of tea bags in her cupboard. She usually makes her tea by just steeping a tea bag in boiling water for the same amount of time regardless of tea type.

I am no tea expert, but I do know quite a bit about brewing coffee. Knowing from the coffee world that water temperature and steep time are a large portion of what goes into brewing coffee just right, I can only imagine those are critical to brewing tea as well. So, my plan for this Christmas is to buy her a temperature-controlled kettle and a nice tea infuser that has plenty of space for the tea to expand.

The other big thing that I've learned from coffee is that you can have amazing equipment and technique but still create a terrible cup if you don't have good ingredients. I'm hoping I can buy her a tea sampler from a seller that makes a good ""daily driver"" tea: Something that tastes pretty good but doesn't break the bank.

If possible, I'd like the sampler to have different categories of teas (white, green, oolong, black), so she can practice setting the different temperatures for each type of tea as well as navigating the differences in steep time for each type.

Essentially, the goal is to get my mom into learning more about her tea, and getting a lot more out of it. I'm almost certain this is something that she would really enjoy, but she just hasn't ever had time to dive into a hobby while raising us kids. Now almost all of us are out of the house, so she would have more time for something like this.",1606330270

Haha, I've been struggling to brew my Silver Needle properly. I brewed it one time to perfection and instantly fell in love with tea and wanted to know everything about tea. It was so sweet and creamy and tasted as if I put some honey in there.

I've been brewing it Gong-Fu style with one of those tea pots with the button on top. These days I either get it flavorless or bitter with none of that after taste. I'm really at a loss here. I tried brewing it at 185 degrees, 190 degrees, 175 degrees, tried brewing it for longer and tried brewing it for less time. 

What could be the reason for this? How did I get my tea to be so perfect?

Instructions were brew white tea at 185 degrees for 20s being the first infusion and 10s for subsequent infusions and this is what I believe I did when I got my perfect tea. Ofc, that's after the wash. I'm honestly lost here and would love some tips.

This is bug bitten Gui Fei Oolong (Taiwanese) from Mei Leaf. This is the only non-grocery tea I've had in my entire life. So you can imagine the experience I had this morning. Just mindblown and left without any words. 

Obviously I'm not great at distinguishing the different notes and flavors (even though I'm quite good with food and wine), but even a kid could distinguish the strong tree resin aroma. It was delicious. It was watery/juicy with sweet aftertaste (ngl I didn't find any sweetness at the beginning, but the aftertaste between infusions surprised me). 

&amp;#x200B;

I made 17 steeps, but after the 10th one some dryness entered the game, but definitely not some bad astringency. After the 12th steep the taste/flavors were out of the game entirely, but even the 17th steep (95C) was as fragrant as the first ones. I don't understand how a non-scented tea is so fragrant. Oh and the color remained the same (90 seconds brew time for the later steeps). I'm in love :D 

I've had loose leaf oolong from the grocery store before, but it was nowhere near than this whole leaf tea. It's like I've never tried Oolong before - so much smoother and different than my  past experiences. 

I can't wait to try everything from the bigger order from What-Cha and to compare What-Cha and Mei Leaf. Mei Leaf is way more expensive and I don't know if it's worth it, that's why I ordered from 2 vendors. Is $0.28/g a good price for everyday tea or should I look for cheaper tea ($.15/g)?

&amp;#x200B;

What tea should I try next if I loved this very aromatic bug bitten Oolong? I definitely prefer this to the stronger malty black teas and I'm not a fan of the vegetal notes in the green tea as well. Are there any black teas that are more fragrant and sweet like this Gui Fei Oolong? I suppose the Taiwanese teas are generally more fragrant and not just their Oolongs? 

I can't wait to try more. This is the my new favorite hobby. Why did I find this whole new world so late in my life... 

Something good came from 2020 finally... Thank you, bad year.

Coffee,Geisha vs. Gesha.,"I have been drinking some great Panama Auromar Gesha coffee from Proud Mary lately, and thought I'd share my opinion and maybe hear from others about their opinion.

Gesha coffee comes from the region around the village of Gesha, Ethiopia. It is a variety of the plant species *Coffea arabica*. A variety is a type of a species, and a cultivar is a derivative of a variety. So Gesha is pretty special in that it's more unique than what may normally people think varieties are (bourbon, striped bourbon, blue mountain). To be honest, I'm not sure people give these much thought either way, as the flavours must overlap a lot between cultivars. But just a little background.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/CoffeaArabica_02.jpg

So with a little reading about the increasing popularity of Gesha, and my first tastings, I've seen so much Geisha that I think it should be brought to light that using the much lauded marketing term is wrong; and some gentle pushback to the real name should be encouraged.

The reason for this is twofold. 

1. Calling this variety the wrong name does this coffee and the people who have grown and cultivated it a disservice. Geishas are from Japan. Gesha is a small region in Ethiopia. Neither are likely to be confused with each other on their own, but one has name recognition and the other does not. 
The people of Ethiopia deserve to have their coffee recognised for what it is, in the same way that every local cultivar or variety is. Like arabica itself, names are important. They give the locality their fame and their rewards. A look at the cultivar chart shows that many cultivars are named after a place of origin and those names are not changed. The only reason to change it here is marketing. 

2. Cultural appropriation is a thing. Geishas are Japanese entertainers, usually associated with luxury and elegance. It's no surprise why this term would so easily be attributed to a region that sounds similar. Very clever word play. But at the same time, Geishas are one of those things that in Japan mean something different than they mean to foreigners (I am myself a Japanese American). The ""mysterious orient"", weeb culture, and ""cool Japan"" are still things that get in the way of seeing Japanese culture as just another culture that can be appreciated and also criticized. While I don't mind and in fact enjoy Japan being glamourized, using the term Geisha in this instance creates just another barrier to seeing people as just people, which really is what we should all strive for.

All in all, the cultural appropriation aspect to me is really a secondary point. The biggest problem is that we are not giving the people from Gesha their respective appreciation and dues, and that in itself is wrong. Proud Mary sell their coffee as Geisha, and I'm just going to write a short email with this message and suggest that it be changed with maybe Geisha in small text. It would be great to have other people do the same if it comes up. Or just reinforce that this coffee does in fact come from Ethiopia, and isn't created by the tiny footsteps of Japanese maidens. It's just a little thing, but this took me 10 minutes to write, and I think just getting on this soapbox is worth the effort. Thanks for your consideration!",1608337184

Coffee,Did anyone else receive a stale Advent Calendar from Onyx?,"Hi all! 

(throwaway account)

2020 has a been a rough year for me as for many people. I thought I would do something nice for the holidays as a treat to myself and got an Onyx Coffee Advent Calendar. I'm a huge fan of Onyx and order from them often, despite the high prices and things like the recent change to smaller packages while raising the price. I love other roasters but Onyx always seems like a level above in terms of bean quality. The calendar is super pricy (150$, they sent me a late one so it was 125$). I was soooo excited to receive it, and honestly would not have taken the chance of 125$ of coffee from a roaster I didn't already know and trust. The problem? Every single sample I've tried in the calendar is STALE AF. Like more stale than the emergency old leftover coffee I keep in my cupboard  in case I run out of beans. I even have a bag of Krampus from about a month ago, so not ideal freshness but still edible, and it's still 100% better than the nitro flushed sample of Krampus they included with the calendar. I actually threw out that brewed Krampus from the calendar it was so awful.  And that's just one example. I haven't changed anything with my brewing method, equipment, etc. 

I reached out to the company to express my disappointment bc wtf, fully expecting them to do something to make this right since Onyx usually has good customer service. They said ""sorry your beans taste different than usual (they're not different they're STALE AF), here's a 20% coupon for your next order"". I usually order one or two bags at a time so around 30-50$, so they're offering 6-7$ discount on 125$ of stale beans. For the amount of coffee included, someone else on this reddit pointed out that it works out to 50$/lb. Has anyone else had a similar experience with this calendar? 

At this point I'm going to try writing them again  and if they don't do anything, I'm going to contest the charge on my credit card as this is coffee is just not drinkable to me at all.  My old coffee from this summer left ofter in the cupboard in case I run out of beans tastes fresher than this. I feel really crushed as I was so looking forward to this, and I'm honestly kind of stunned by their crappy response. 

Thanks for any info or suggestions on what to do.

Coffee,Recommendation for Daily Brew Method,"I would like recommendations for a method or specific product I can use to make about 4-5 cups of coffee, but doesn't take so much time to make like a pour-over does. I want to be able to get ready in the morning without having to be too involved, but I need enough coffee for me and my SO.

I am not well versed in coffee brewing. My SO and I have use a $20 drip machine the past 2 years, but I am ready to spend a bit more on a coffee maker (\~$150-200). We are using an OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder, and I order Peets Major Dickason's blend from the site because there are essentially no local roasters nearby (nearest one looks about 70 miles away), and I really enjoy the taste.

I was considering the Bonavita Connoisseur 8-cup ($150). Or is French press the way to go? Not sure how I feel about having to heat up the carafe. Thank you for everyone's time and input!",1608320974
Coffee,Bad quality Bonavita BV1901TS -- should I go Moccamaster?,"After years of drip coffee by hand (V60, Clever, Aeropress, and Chemex), the amount of coffee we drink at home during the pandemic has led us to go for an electric brewer. We ordered a Bonavita Connoisseur BV1901TS and it arrived yesterday. Right out of the box and the first water drips I noticed three issues:
- The plastic on the outside top of the carafe is split in two. 
- The plastic on the base is cracked too. 
- The machine let out a large amount of steam at the end of the three test runs which drenched the upper cabinets. It also gurgled a lot throughout. 

Does this sound like a lemon from an otherwise good model, or is this representative of Bonavita quality nowadays? We've been using a Bonavita electric pourover kettle for 6 years and it's been solid. 

I'm wondering whether to replace with the same model, go down to another Bonavita, or bite the bullet and go Moccamaster. Advice is very welcome!

Thanks!

Coffee,Bitterness on V60,"I was doing some tests and brew a cup on my V60 (13gr coffee for 210ml)  with a fine grind (14 clicks on a Comandante) and quite hot water (96C). Drawdown was quite slow (4 minutes), and I was expecting a pretty bitter cup, but it actually came out quite nice. What could be happening here?

EDIT: To be a bit more clear, I was trying to get an over-extracted cup on purpose. Most of the V60 recipes I'm familiar with tend to use around 22-25 clicks and water around 92-93C, so this had a much finer grind and hotter temp. I have also previously gotten bitter cups with the same beans (Nicaragua Washed Java by La Cabra), so I was surprised to not get bitterness with these settings. Was curious.",1608303459
Coffee,Chemex - Number of Pours?,"I am new to Chemex and have an 8-cup brewer. I didn't have much luck trying to make a full carafe, so I've settled on making half a carafe with 37 g of beans and 20 oz of water at 202 degrees F.

When I was researching brew methods, I couldn't find much consistency in recipes as far as how much time to wait between pours, how many pours to do, how much water in each pour, etc. So, I decided to just do a bloom, and then pour as much water as possible up to about 0.5 inches below the top of the cone. I add the remaining water to reach 20 oz once there is room in the cone.

This is giving me a good brew and I pull the filter out at 4:00, which is shortly after the brew starts going from a steady stream to drips.

Basically, I'm doing the bloom, one main pour, and then one top-off pour. It has made me curious, though...

What effect does number of pours actually have? Does the water/slurry lose more heat with fewer pours (the water sits in the cone instead of the kettle)? Does more water in the cone create more pressure and increase rate of water passing through the coffee? I'm just trying to figure out if I ""need"" to experiment with more pours.

I tried doing more pours one time and noticed the brew ended up taking longer than 4:00, so I went back to my previous method. I don't really understand why more pours would take longer.

Also, suppose I DID want to make a full-carafe. Do I need to grind coarser to reduce brew time? Twice as much water (and coffee) seems like it would take at least twice as long to brew if I didn't change the grind. Or SHOULD brew time increase when you brew more coffee? Is the 3:30 to 4:30 benchmark only for when making a couple of cups?

Thanks!",1608303144

Coffee,My Moccamaster makes better coffee than my V60,"I know this is the opposite to what most people report here! I've been making pourovers, first with the Kalita Wave and then with the V60, for 3-4 years now. I thought I was doing a reasonable job. Then six months ago we bought a Moccamaster (thermal jug) and I think it produces far more full-bodied yet nuanced coffee, while my V60 brews lack subtlety and all tend to taste the same.

What am I doing wrong? At least I have some idea of what I'm aiming for but how to get there?

Moccamaster: 1 litre water, 60g coffee. I shut off the valve, let the holder fill with water, pull the jug out to stop the water flow, stir, let sit for about 30 seconds, open the valve and push the jug back in to restart the flow. When it's done I give it a swirl and agitate a few times clockwise and anticlockwise then leave it alone as it drains.

V60: 500g water, 30g coffee. Hoffmann method. Also tried Rao. Generally aim for 3 min extraction. Water boiled in kettle then warmed on stove in Kalita kettle until it gets to about 97C.

Grind: Same in both cases using my Niche, would be about 62 if the scale extended past the end. Have also used Comandante set to about 26. I know numbers mean nothing but included here to give a general idea.",1608280647

tea,Why is my ripe Pu'er bland?,"I bought one of those large round cakes a year ago from Yunnan Sourcing for about $45. I really enjoyed it, and still do, but the taste seems to be getting weaker. Am I just getting used to it? I'm at the point where I was using 7-8g per 100 with near boiling water and still no rich flavors. Just very general wet piled taste? Woodsy, earthy, minerally, borderline salty. Am I just adjusting finally to a cheap Pu'er and maybe should invest in something that will be a bit more complex, fruit, etc?",1606079975

tea,What sorts of non-tea related gifts would you like in a tea gift basket?,"Hi, I'm making a gift basket for my brother and theming a lot of the gifts around tea. I got him a little sampler set, a few holiday themed teas, a dragonfruit tea I personally like a lot and a cute teapot. What other things do you think would go well in this? I was thinking of getting some sort of sweetener (I saw a barrel aged whiskey maple syrup that could be cool) or some sort of food that would go well with a lightly flavored black tea (not something I know a lot about). I'd like to keep the price under $30, any suggesting would be greatly appreciated!",1606078427
